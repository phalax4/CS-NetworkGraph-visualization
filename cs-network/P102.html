<H2>CS361C (Project) Assignment 5a</H2>

<P><B>Due:</B> the paper is due Friday, March 27 at class time.
  Submit a hard copy of your paper.<P>

Your group should prepare a report and presentation on the topic
you've claimed and described in assignment 4.  Your report should
summarize the topic and current research on the topic succinctly and
precisely.  It should indicate that you have done the research
necessary to understand the topic. The formatting requirements for
this paper are described below.<P>

Beginning Monday (3/30), your group should be prepared to give a
presentation on your paper and answer any questions that may arise
relating to your topic.  I would suggest preparing PowerPoint (or
equivalent) for the presentation.  <i>The presentation order will be
decided by a lottery which will be posted as soon as assignment 4 is
complete.</i><P>

Due to the number of groups and limited time, prepare for a 20 minute
presentation.  <b>Your group must not go over 25 minutes.</b>  I'll
cut you off if you do.  The goal is to have two presentations each
day, so the limit is very firm. It is much better if you prepare to
highlight your findings, and not try to cover everything.  Also,
designate one or two folks to present.  Don't have all members of your
group present.<P>

Your paper should contain 2 pages of text for each group member.  E.g., if
your group contains 5 members, you need to produce a 10 page paper,
independent of graphs, pictures, figures, etc. The paper must be
formatted using LaTeX.  The following documents illustrate the format
requirements: 
<A HREF="sample-paper.tex">Formatting guidelines input</A>,
<A HREF="sample-paper.ps">Formatting guidelines output (postscript)</A>,
<A HREF="sample-paper.pdf">Formatting guidelines output (pdf)</A>,
<A HREF="sample.bib">Sample bibliography file</A>.<P>

You must have this file in the directory where you are creating
your paper: <A HREF="hicss.sty">style file</A>.  It is the LaTeX style
file that defines the format.  Don't modify it to adjust margins or
spacing, fonts, etc.  If you need to make other modification, you
can.<P>

Use either latex (and dvips) to generate a postscript version of the
paper, or pdflatex to generate a pdf version.  Either should work,
though the input format for figures may be slightly different in the
two cases.  Use bibtex to generate the bibliography.  Ask for help
with any of these things. <P>

Some writing guidelines are
here: <A HREF="hints-on-writing-a-paper.html">Writing Guidelines.</A>
You are strongly advised to follow these.  The most important proviso
is to make sure that you don't plagarize.  If you get lazy and try to
copy all or a portion of your report from the Internet, you will
suffer.<P>

I will be reading your papers and returning them to you with
comments.  My plan is to have all of them read and returned by the end
of the presentations.  You will then revise your paper in response to
the comments and submit a revised version by May 1.<P>

<HR>

<H2>CS361C Assignment 5b </H2>

<P><B>Due:</B> the day after we finish the presentations. <P>

Prepare two "quiz" questions for each of the presentations (including
your own).  Imagine that you were preparing a quiz to test your
classmates' attentiveness during the presentation.  Write two
questions to see if they were paying attention.  Make them about the
substantive issues of the presentations, not about trivial matters.
They should be questions that would be answered by a short essay, not
short answer questions. <P>

If it happens that you miss a presentation day, you must indicate that
on your assignment. I.e., don't prepare questions for any
presentations you missed.  <b>Each individual is expected to do this
assignment, no matter how many are in your group. Do not copy someone
else's questions.</b><P>

You don't have to prepare questions for your own presentation.<P>
