<H2>Notes on CS 314 Assignment 3: More Recursion and Lists</H2>

<P>

<OL>

<LI> Write functions that find the <TT>sum</TT>, <TT>mean</TT> or average
(mean = (sum x<SUB>i</SUB>) / n),
<TT>meansq</TT> (mean square = (sum x<SUB>i</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>) / n),
<TT>variance</TT>, and
<TT>stddev</TT> (standard deviation) of a list of <TT>Integer</TT>.
<P>
If the assignment does not specify it, you can use either iteration,
recursion, or tail recursion (your choice).  You can always use
any of your functions from previous assignments, or functions from
the class notes.
<P>
A formula for variance is shown below.  Using the functions for mean
and mean square as subroutines makes this one easy.
<P>
<IMG SRC="variance.png">
<P>
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
You can use <TT>Math.sqrt()</TT> .

<LI>  The sine function can be computed from its Taylor 
series expansion:
<PRE>
          1    3    5    7    9
         x    x    x    x    x
sin(x) = -- - -- + -- - -- + -- - ...
         1!   3!   5!   7!   9!
</PRE>
Write a function <TT>double sine(double x)</TT> to compute sine
using this series.  You may not use the functions <TT>Math.pow</TT>
or <TT>factorial</TT>;
instead, write a tail-recursive auxiliary function to compute each 
term of the series from the previous term and add it to the 
sum.  Stop after the 21st power of x.
<P>
Hint: write down how each term of the series differs from the previous term.
<P>
Your result should be very close to <TT>Math.sin()</TT> for small values
of x (say, x less than 0.6), i.e. the same for 14 digits or so.

<P>
<LI> <TT>nthcdr(int n, Cons lst)</TT> just applies 
<TT>rest</TT> to <TT>lst</TT> <TT>n</TT> times (<TT>cdr</TT>,
pronounced "could-er", was the original name given to <TT>rest</TT>).
<P>
<PRE>
>(nthcdr 3 '(a b c d e))

(D E)
</PRE>
<P>
<TT>nthcdr</TT> is a standard function in Lisp, as are most of the
rest of the functions in this assignment.  If you are using Lisp, you will
need to rename this function to avoid conflict.  You can check whether
a function name is already used with <TT>fboundp</TT>:
<TT>(fboundp 'mapcar)</TT>

<P>
<LI> Write a function <TT>elt(Cons lst, int n)</TT> that retrieves
the <TT>n</TT><SUP>th</SUP> item.  This is a one-liner if you use
<TT>nthcdr</TT> as a subroutine.
<P>
The method <TT>List.get(n)</TT> in Java is similar.
<P>
<PRE>
>(elt '(a b c d e) 3)

D
</PRE>

<P>
<LI> Write a function <TT>double interpolate(Cons lst, double x)</TT>
that will make <TT>lst</TT>, a list of <TT>Integer</TT>, appear to be a
continuous function by linearly interpolating for values of <TT>x</TT>.
<P>
<TT>interpolate</TT> just returns a number (it does not do any graphics).
<P>
We have values for some variable that are taken at discrete time points.
For example, the newspaper publishes the temperature at each hour
for the previous day.  We want to know the temperature at 8:37 when what
we have is temperatures at 8:00, 9:00, etc.  So what we can do is to
interpolate between the 8:00 and 9:00 temperatures to estimate the
temperature at 8:37.
<P>
So, what we are doing is to take a set of discrete point measurements
and make it look like a continuous function by connecting the dots
with straight lines.
<P>
Linear interpolation is the simplest kind. There are more complex kinds
of interpolation that do a better job with curvy lines.

<P>
<LI> Write a recursive function <TT>sumtr(Cons lst)</TT>
that adds all the numbers in <TT>lst</TT>.
The list <TT>lst</TT> may contain not only <TT>Integer</TT>, but
also sublists, recursively.
<P>
The "tr" in the name is for "tree"; this function actually is operating
on a tree with numbers at the leaves.
<P>
Actually, this function is easy.  Start with the <TT>sum</TT> function
that you wrote above.  The only difference from the <TT>sum</TT> function
is that some of the things in the list are not <TT>Integer</TT> (you can
use <TT>consp</TT> to test if you found a <TT>Cons</TT>).  If it is a
<TT>Cons</TT>, all you need is a function to add up its contents ...
don't you have such a function already?

<P>
<LI> Write a function <TT>subseq(Cons lst, int start, int end)</TT>
that returns a new list that is a sub-sequence of <TT>lst</TT>
beginning with the item numbered <TT>start</TT> and including
items through <TT>end - 1</TT>.
<P>
<TT>subseq</TT> needs to be <TT>cons</TT>tructive, i.e. you need to use
<TT>cons</TT> to build the output, so that you don't mess up the input.
Be sure to think about using an earlier function as a subroutine.
<P>
If your technique makes the output list backwards (e.g. using tail recursion)
and you want to use <TT>nreverse</TT> to get it into the right order
before returning it, that is okay; this is a standard idiom, and the
only exception to our rule of "no destructive functions" in assignments.

<P>
<LI> A <I>filter</I> is a function that allows desired elements
to pass through, while removing undesired elements.
Write a recursive function <TT>posfilter(Cons lst)</TT> that
returns a new list containing only the non-negative values in
<TT>lst</TT>, a list of <TT>Integer</TT>, in the same order as in
the original list.
<P>
<TT>posfilter</TT> should be <TT>cons</TT>tructive.
<P>
<LI> A <I>predicate</I> is a <TT>boolean</TT> function, which
tests its argument and returns <TT>true</TT> or <TT>false</TT>.
Write a recursive function <TT>subset(Predicate p, Cons lst)</TT>
that returns a new list containing only the values in
<TT>lst</TT> that satisfy the predicate <TT>p</TT>.  In mathematical
notation, this would be written { x &isin; lst | p(x) }, pronounced
<I>the set of x in lst such that p(x)</I>.
We will
assume that <TT>p.pred(item)</TT> can be used to test an item.
<P>
Java does not allow a function to be passed as an argument to
another function.  However, it is possible to do this by making
the function a method of a class and passing an element of that
class as an argument.
<P>


<LI> A <I>mapping</I> relates an element of a set, called its
<I>domain</I>, to an element of another set, called its <I>range</I>;
we write <I>M: D &rarr; R</I>.
Write a recursive function <TT>mapcar(Functor f, Cons lst)</TT>
that returns a new list containing the results of applying
<TT>f.fn(item)</TT> to each item in the list <TT>lst</TT>.

<P>
<TT>mapcar</TT> is important to us because it is the first half
of MapReduce, a powerful system for using large numbers of computers
in parallel to process large data.
<P>

<LI> Write a recursive function
<TT>Object some(Predicate p, Cons lst)</TT>
that returns the first item in <TT>lst</TT> that satisfies the
predicate <TT>p</TT>.  In mathematical notation, this would be
written &exist; x &nbsp; p(x), and pronounced <I>there exists an x
such that p(x)</I> or <I>for some x, p(x)</I>.

<P>
<LI> Write a recursive function
<TT>boolean every(Predicate p, Cons lst)</TT>
that tests whether every item in <TT>lst</TT> satisfies the
predicate <TT>p</TT>.  In mathematical notation, this would be
written &forall; x &nbsp; p(x), and pronounced <I>for all x, p(x)</I>.
