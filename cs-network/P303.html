<h1 align = center>CS439: Principles of Computer Systems</h1>
<h4 align=center>Fall 2017</h4>
</align>
<h2>Basic Information</h2>
<p>
Welcome!  This course is an introduction to computer systems
software---low-level software abstractions with an emphasis on the
connection of these abstractions to underlying computer hardware. Key
abstractions include threads, dynamic memory allocation, protection,
and I/O.
<p>
There are three interrelated goals for this course. The first goal is
to understand how operating systems and, more generally, computers
work. Students graduating with CS degrees should believe "there is no
magic": they should be able to describe the chain of events that
occurs when they hit a key and cause a letter to appear on the screen
from the register level (or logical gate level or transistor level) to
the system architecture level to the operating system level to the
application level. This is philosophically important, but it is also
of practical interest to developers who need to figure out how to make
a system do what they want it to do.
<p>
The second goal is for you to learn the core ideas in operating
systems: virtual addressing, memory protection, concurrent
programming, file systems, scheduling, transactions, etc. Often, but
not always, such ideas are best explained as abstractions that some
software layer (usually the operating system) provides above imperfect
hardware to make that hardware usable by programmers and users. The
intent is for you to understand such abstractions well enough to be
able to synthesize new abstractions when faced with new problems.
<p>
Many of the ideas and abstractions that we will cover are relevant not
only to OS kernels but also to many large-scale systems. Thus, a third
goal of this course is to enhance your ability to understand, design,
use, and implement such systems.
<p>
<p>
During this course, you will have an opportunity to learn a lot of
practical information about how programming languages, operating
systems, and architectures interact and how to use each effectively.
The written and programming assignments are designed to build on and
enhance the lectures.  You will hear the concepts in lecture, read
them in the book, analyze them in the written homework, and put them
in practice in the programming assignments.

<p>
<u>Clickers</u>: An iClicker is required for this course and must be
brought to every lecture as participation on iClicker questions is
part of your course grade.  For this class, an iClicker is sufficient.
However, an iClicker+ or an iClicker2 will also work.<br>
<p>
  Register your iClicker at
  <a href="https://www.iclicker.com/remote-registration-form-for-classic">
  https://www.iclicker.com/remote-registration-form-for-classic</a> by providing:
  <ul>
    <li>your first name </li>
    <li>your last name </li>
    <li>your UT EID (which they call your ``student ID'') </li>
    <li>your clicker's ID (the serial number under the bar code on the back of 
    the device) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even if you already have an iClicker and registered it to your
  EID in the past, <b>you must re-register for this semester</b>.
	<p>
	  If you do not know the serial number for your iClicker but have registered
	  it previously, you can use
	  <a href="https://www1.iclicker.com/register-your-remote/remote-id-lookup-tool/"</a>the
		 Remote ID Lookup Tool</a> from iClicker.  If you have not registered it
		 previously, take your iClicker to the ITS office in FAC to retrieve the
		 ID.  (Be sure to write it down!)
<p>
<b>Communication:</b>
<p>
<u>Discussion</u>: The class discussion board is on Piazza.  You may
sign up at this
link: <a href="http://piazza.com/utexas/fall2017/cs439n">http://piazza.com/utexas/spring2017/cs439n</a>.  (Note that the course is listed as "CS439N".)
<p>
I will post course-related announcements and information on the board.  You must
read the discussion board at least once per day, and you should post
course-related questions and responses there.  I expect you to make good use of
the discussion group and of TA support when you have technical or
administrative questions or problems.  If you have read at least 85% of the
Piazza posts (as recorded by Piazza, so you must read them through the website)
<em>every time</em> I check during the semester, you will earn ten extra credit
points on your final exam grade.  I will check your progress reading Piazza
randomly, so make it a habit to read Piazza each day.
<p>
You are responsible for any and all information posted to Piazza by
any of the course staff.
<p>
<u>Email to you</u>: In this course, email will be used as a means of
communication with students.  You are responsible for regularly checking both
your CS email and your email officially registered with UT for class work and
announcements.  Your CS address may be forwarded to another account
(see <a href="http://apps.cs.utexas.edu/udb/update/">http://apps.cs.utexas.edu/udb/update/</a>).
<p>
<u>Email to the Instructor or TAs</u>: Emails to course staff should begin with
"CS439:" in the subject line, followed by a brief description of the purpose of
your email.  If you follow this rule, we will be better able to address your
questions in a timely manner.  If you do not, a response to your email may be
delayed indefinitely.
<p>
<u>Facebook, text message, twitter, calling a mobile phone, or other forms of
  informal communication</u>: None of these
should ever be used to communicate with course staff regarding 439 material.


<h2> Expectations </h2>
<p>
<u>Course Structure</u>: Lectures will introduce systems concepts
through description and examples.  A key component of this course is
the active participation of students.  While I will lead you through
the main concepts and provide you with details relevant for
understanding and applying those concepts, you have to provide the
"active learning" component.  By active learning, I mean you must do
things, think about things, ask questions---basically whatever it
takes for you to be engaged.  The format is informal; questions are
welcome all the time.
<p>
<u>Assignment/Lecture Schedule</u>: A schedule of lecture topics,
reading assignments, and assignment distribution and due dates
is <a href="schedule.html">available online, via the class web
page</a>.  The schedule page contains links to lecture slides and
assignments. Readings are to be completed <b> before</b> class.
<p>
The schedule is subject to change, so please check it throughout the semester.
<p>
<u>Required Effort</u>: The workload for this course is heavy.  There
are readings, five projects, twelve problem sets, two exams, and a final.
<p>
To maximize your learning, it is essential that you read the text
prior to each class meeting.  The ideas in this course require
thinking about and getting used to, which is possible only with
multiple exposures to the material.  Also, the readings can be
difficult---so be patient.  Finally, the concepts build on each other,
so you must stay current.  Please make up any missed classes on your
own or with help from your colleagues.
<p>
<u>Professionalism</u>:
Professional conduct is built upon the idea of mutual respect.  Such conduct 
entails (but is not necessarily limited to): 
<ul>
<li> <b>Attending class</b>: The class benefits from the attendance
and participation of all students.  Your grade will be affected by
your attendance and participation. </li>
<li> <b>Arriving on time</b>: Please do not hesitate to come to class,
even if you are arriving late.  I would rather you attend some of
class, than miss out altogether.  However, if you must arrive late or
leave early, please be considerate of others---sit near the door and
move about quietly. </li>
<li> <b>Minimizing disruptions</b>: Modern technology permits constant
communication, but I ask that you leave all digital devices off and
out of reach during class unless you are waiting news of an emergency
nature (wife delivering a baby, critically ill relative, etc.).</li>
<li> <b>Focusing on the class</b>: Laptop computers or hand-held
devices are not allowed in class. </li>
<li> <b>Respect</b>: You should act respectfully toward all class
participants. </li>
</ul>
Professional conduct is expected in this course.
<p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>
<u>Exams and Final</u>: Exams will cover material from lecture,
assignments, and assigned readings.  The exams will be held in the
evening on Wednesday, 10/4, and Wednesday, 11/8.  
<p>
The final will be cumulative, but it may be more heavily weighted towards
material that has not yet been tested.  The final exam will be at a UNIFORM time
with the other sections of CS439 and
<a href="http://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules/179/finals">not the time
listed on the registrar's tentative schedule.</a> The date could be as late as
Wednesday, December 20. The
Registrar usually publishes uniform final exam dates in early November.
<p>
<!-- Makeup exams will only be arranged under exceptional conditions.  In
these cases, missing the exam must be arranged at least one week prior
to the exam date.
<p>-->
<u>iClicker Participation</u>: iClicker participation is measured in
your answers to iClicker questions, so bring your iClicker with you to
lecture.
<b>In order to receive iClicker credit for a given day you
MUST:</b><ul>
  <li>register your clicker prior to class AND</li>
  <li>have your clicker with you in working order AND</li>
  <li>attend the class for which you are registered AND</li>
  <li>answer at least one question during class using the iclicker AND</li>
  <li>sign the roster passed at the beginning of class AND</li>
  <li>have all electronic devices put away for the duration of class.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You are required to attend class, and you are responsible for knowing
or learning any material presented in class. If you must miss class,
you are not required to inform the instructor, but you are responsible
for learning any material you missed. The instructor posts detailed
notes for each class on the course web site, but classes are
interactive, so the actual discussion may depart from the notes. The
best way to know what actually happened in a class is to be there and
participate; if you must miss a class, you should study the notes
carefully and perhaps talk to your colleagues about the technical
topics discussed and what points were particularly emphasized.
<p>
<b>Use of laptops, phones, or other digital devices during lecture
results in the forfeiture of iClicker participation points.</b>
<p>
<u>Discussion Section Attendance</u>: Attendance at discussion section
is mandatory, and you must attend the one for which you are
registered.
<p>

<u>Discussion Section Participation</u>: Discussion sections are designed to
enhance understanding of the concepts and help prepare for the exams.
Additionally, discussion sections are the only place where projects are
introduced and explained.  The first half of the discussion sections will
focus on reviewing lecture, discussing the problem set assigned that
week, and working an additional problem.  The second half of the discussion
section will focus on the projects.
<p>
There will be a written problem set assigned for each discussion section, which
you must work before discussion section and will be discussed and reviewed
during section.  It is essential that you complete the problem set beforehand to
maximize the benefit you get from the discussion, so you can contribute to the
discussion, and so you earn your discussion section credit.  The problem sets
will be posted to the schedule on the course website.
<p>
We will typically rate your discussion section participation on a "OK/Not-OK"
basis, where "OK" means that you made a credible effort to solve the problem set
(even if you make a mistake), participated in the discussion, and remained for
the entire section.  We do reserve the right to grade for correctness as well.

<!--Failure to attend discussion section, participate in the discussion, or complete
the problem set before section results in a loss of credit for that discussion
section. Leaving early also results in a loss of credit for that discussion
section.-->

To receive credit for discussion section, you must:
<ul>
  <li> arrive on time </li>
  <li> arrive with the assigned problem set completed with an
	honest attempt at the answers</li>
  <li> bring a hard copy of your problem set answers </li>
  <li> display your name tent </li>
  <li> participate in the group discussion of problem set answers and summary
	of the lectures</li>
  <li> be ready to present an answer whenever selected by the TA</li>
  <li> participate in other parts of discussion</li>
  <li> stay until discussion section is complete</li>
</ul>
<p>
As in lecture, the use of any electronics during discussion section results in a
loss of credit for that discussion.
<p>
The lowest two discussion section scores will be dropped.
<p>
<u>Projects</u>: There will be five programming projects during the semester.
The due date for each project will be clearly stated in class, on
the <a href="projects/project439.html">project web page</a>, and on the
<a href="schedule.html">schedule</a>. Plan to start early since debugging
systems code can take arbitrarily large amounts of time.  Additionally, respect
Murphy's rule and plan for your bus to run late, your personal computer to crash
the afternoon of the due date, etc.
<p>
For each group project, your group members will evaluate your
contribution.  <b>For your first project where your average ranking is Marginal
or below you will receive a warning.  For every project after that where your
	average ranking is Marginal or below, your final
course grade will be reduced by a letter grade.</b>
<p>
All projects must be submitted using Canvas. We will not
accept assignments e-mailed to us.  All projects are due just before
midnight (11:59pm) on their due date.  Projects are dated by Canvas.
<p>
Project code must compile and be submitted in the correct format.  <b>Projects
that do not compile or are in the wrong format will receive a 0.</b>  Design
documents must be completed individually and submitted as plain text.
Additionally, design documents must contain minimal spelling and grammar errors
or points will be deducted.  All other given turnin instructions must also be
followed exactly.
<p>
Finally, all groups (and individual group members) must have a working Project 2
before moving on to Project 3.  Groups may either meet this requirement by
submitting a working project before the deadline or groups may meet with course
staff to demonstrate a working project within ten days of the deadline.  A
reasonable amount of assistance will be provided.  This policy does mean that a
student may not leave a group that does not have a working Project 2 to work
with a group that does.  Once a working Project 2 has been submitted, students
may join whichever group they wish for the remaining projects.
<p>
<u>Late Policy</u>: You will have 4 slip days in 1 day units (that is,
1 minute to 24 hours late = 1 slip day, etc.) to use throughout the
semester to extend project deadlines. However, you may only use two
slip days on any particular project, and you may use no slip days on
the final project.  Other than that, you may divide your slip days
across the projects in any way you wish, subject to the 4 day total
and the 2 day per project maximum.  Slip days are to account for life
circumstances and emergencies.  Do not use your slip days frivolously.
If you use all your slip days and then cannot turn in your project on
time <b>for any reason</b> then you will receive a 0 for that project.
<p>
Note that each project has two pieces (the code and the design document), but
that it is considered one assignment, so that if you submit both pieces two days
late, you lose two slips days, not four.
<p>
In the case of group and pair programming, each member of the team must have
enough slip days to cover the submission of the project code.  So if the team
submits the code 2 days late, each team member must have two slip days
remaining to use and each team member will lose two slip days.  Design documents
are completed individually, and so the student submitting the design document
must have enough slip days to cover any deadline extensions and only that
student will be docked slip days.
<p>
To use slip days, you only need to submit the assignment late and
indicate that you used a slip day in the project README or the design
document header, whichever is appropriate.  You do not need to email
the instructor or the TA unless specifically requested to do so.
<p>
<u>Grading</u>: Grades are essential to insuring that your degree has
the value that it deserves.  As a result, we have a grading system
that has two essential properties:
<ul>
<li>It is fair to everyone in the class.</li>
<li>It is a true measure of how much each student knows the class
material.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These class components are used to determine your final average in the
following manner:

<p>
The course uses the plus/minus grading scale and will likely be graded on a
small curve, with the score-to-letter-grade mapping determined by the instructor
based on factors such as the difficulty of an assignment, the types of errors
people are making, etc.
<!-- During the semester, I will give rough estimates of where grade cut-offs
lie, but these will be deliberately somewhat vague; if knowing where a cut-off
is within a few points will affect how you study, you're worrying too much about
grades and not enough about the material (Plus, it's a really bad idea to gauge
your effort by what you think you need to make to get a particular letter
grade). I want everyone in the class to do well, and if everyone masters the
material and gets good marks, I will happily abandon the curve and give "extra"
As and Bs.--> I guarantee that anyone who gets a grade of 90% or
more of the total points will get at least an A-, anyone with 80% or more will
get at least a B-, and anyone with 70% or more of the points will get at least a
C-. 
<p>
I grade on a curve rather than an absolute scale because it protects students
from stressing out if I happen to give an overly hard exam or final. The
downside of grading on a curve is that it tends to lead students to think they
are competing against each other. In practice, this worry is misplaced. First, I
will set grade cut-offs for the course to correspond to the quality of the work
and depth of understanding reflected by each range of scores and not by the
number of students that make each range of scores. Second, note that the impact
of any individual score on the overall class distribution is trivial---for
example someone making a 10% better grade on a exam raises the class semester
average by .1%.
<p>
Also, for these types of projects students often stress about whether
they will be penalized because their project may not be as elaborate
as that of some of the other groups in the class. Again, this is not
something to worry about. The projects are hard enough without looking
over your shoulder at other students. By and large, most students do
quite well on the projects---the consequence is that the projects have
less effect than you might think on the curve. A warning, however: if
you punt the projects, you will fail the course.
<p>
Your grades are recorded in the gradebook on Canvas.
<p>
If you have questions or concerns about your grade, contact your TA
during office hours or by email.
<p>
 
<u>Grade Changes</u>: If you believe your work was graded incorrectly, you may
submit a complaint to the grader.
<p>
For project grades and discussion section participation credits, you must submit
an email complaint to the grader <i>within one week</i> of the date on which we
first attempted to return the graded work to you. For assignments where your
feedback is given electronically, the deadline is one week from the time the
grade became available on Canvas.  Your complaint must contain supporting
evidence and arguments which explain why your work was graded incorrectly. (For
example, it is not sufficient to submit a note that says "regrade question 3".)
Grade change requests that do not meet these requirements will not be
considered.  Note that we only unmute assignments on Canvas when all grades are
entered.  If an assignment is unmuted and you do not have a grade at all, you
should be worried and submit a grade change request following the above
guidelines.
<p>
For exam grades, complaints must be written and returned with your copy of the
exam <em>before you leave the discussion section in which we return the exam to
you</em>.  Your complaint must explain why your answer was not graded according
to the given rubric.  Complaints not following this format will not be
considered, not will complaints that argue the rubric (see below about which
grade discussions are inappropriate).
<p>
Regrade requests are not given priority over any current grading, as so a
response to your request may be delayed.
<p>  
Note that assigned grades are not the starting point of a negotiation. This
isn't a weekend bazaar---unless we have made a mistake in grading your work
(i.e., you have a correct answer that was marked wrong, or your score was added
incorrectly), your grade is final.

<p>Note that none of the following grade discussions is appropriate:

<ul>
<li> <i>"I know my answer was wrong, but I deserve more partial credit
points."</i><br> When we grade, we make decisions about how many points to
give for various kinds of wrong answers. This is never a clear cut
decision.  The important thing is that we make some decision and then
implement it fairly for everyone. It is completely unfair to come back
later and give one person more points just because they ask. We won't
do it.
</li>
<br>
<li> <i>"I don't like my final grade. It will ruin my life for the
following reason: ... Therefore you should give me a better one."</i>
<br>Class grades reflect only one thing: how well you did in the
class. Life circumstances just don't play a role here. Don't come to
me with this kind of argument.
</li>
<br>
<li> <i>"I don't like my final grade. I am desperate. Isn't there some
sort of extra credit thing I could do?"</i> <br>Any answer other than "No" to
this question would be completely unfair to other students in the
class unless they were all offered this option. That would be
equivalent to saying that the semester isn't over and everyone can
keep trying. We're not going to do this. Final grades are final.
</li>
<br>
<li> <i>"I don't like my final grade. Can I have an incomplete and try
again?"</i> <br>There are University rules for giving incompletes. If you meet
those rules (e.g., you had a medical problem during the semester),
then, of course, come and tell me and ask for an incomplete. But make
sure you do it as soon as you can. Do not wait until the semester is
over. If you do not meet the rules, the answer is "No".
</li>
<br>
<li> <i>"I don't like my final grade. It doesn't reflect what I really
know. I guess I didn't show what I know on the exams, but won't you
give me a chance to convince you that I really know this stuff."</i>
<br>Again, any answer other than "No" would be unfair to everyone else.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<u>Pair and Group Programming</u>: On most or all of the projects (as specified
in the project description) you must work with at least one other person.  You
must follow the pair programming guidelines below and on the course web page.
All students will receive the same grade for the project. Unless group or pair
programming is specifically allowed, all assignments must be done
alone---including all problem sets.
<p>
We use <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair
programming</A> because it is a more effective and time efficient way
to learn the material. Researchers have shown that students perform
better in the class in which they use pair programming than without,
and also they perform better in subsequent classes with or without it.
These results indicate that you learn more and better with pair
programming.  Please read:

<ul>
<li>
 <A HREF="docs/kindergarten.pdf">All I need to know about pair programming
I learned in kindergarten</A>, L. A. Williams and
R. R. Kessler, <i>Communications of the ACM</i>, 43(5): 108--114, May
2000.

K. C.C. Chan, <i>International Journal on Human-Computer Studies</i>,
64: 915--925, June 2006.
</ul>
<p> You must follow the pair programming guidelines: the pair must: (1) sit,
design, and program together at least 80% of the time, and (2) split keyboard
time evenly.  Each student can work independently for at most 10% of the
effort/time. The person at the keyboard is the driver, and the person sitting
next to him/her is the navigator. We recommend you alternate driving and
navigating every 30 minutes.
<p> For some parts of the course, you will be allowed to change partners between
assignments.  However, once you begin an assignment with a partner (or a group),
you cannot change partners or groups for that assignment.  If you must stop
working with your partner or group, please request permission from the
instructor and await further instruction.
<p> If your partner falls out of communication with you, it is your
  responsibility to notify the course staff.
  
<h2>Collaboration and Cheating</h2>
<p>
You are encouraged to study for exams,
<b>discuss</b> the homeworks and projects, and discuss debugging
techniques with your colleagues.  You are welcome to use existing
public libraries in your programming assignments (such as public
classes for queues, trees, etc.)  You may also look at operating
systems code for public domain software such as Linux.  Such
activities qualify under approved collaboration practices and you are
welcome to take advantage of them.  If you are
unsure about whether a particular source of external information is permitted,
contact the instructor before looking at it.
<p>
Note that cooperation is not the same thing as cheating.  The project,
homeworks, and exams must be the work of the student turning them in.
Materials from the web should only be used for educational
purposes. For example, you can read about threads and look at examples
of thread code, but you must not copy any code from the web or be
looking at any of this code from the web when writing anything you
turn in. If you discuss an assignment with another student or look at
examples from the web, you should employ the following technique:
after a discussion with another student or looking at example code you
should do something that has nothing to do with computer science or
programming for at least half an hour before resuming programming.
<p>
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are
subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of
failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Because
such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity
of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced.  <b>The penalty for cheating on an exam, quiz, or assignment
in this course is an F in the course and a referral to the Dean of
Students office.</b>

<p> It is generally okay to verbally discuss the concepts needed to do
projects or homeworks. Three guidelines will help you keep on the
right side of the line.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
   First, other than the TA and instructor, it is never okay to
   look at the written work of another person or show another person
   your written work until after all grading on an assignment is
   completed. This includes looking at paper print-outs, sketching
   solutions on a white board or napkin, or looking at a screen to
   help debugging. <b>The moment you start looking at another
   student's (or pair's) source code you have crossed the line into
   cheating</b>. It should go without saying that copying other
   people's code or solution sets is strictly prohibited.
   <b>You also may not look at any course project material relating to any
project similar to or the same as this course's class projects.</b> For example,
you may not look at the work done by a student in past years' courses, and you
   may not look at similar course projects at other universities.
</li>
<li> Second, while you are discussing an assignment with another
  student, you must not have a writing implement, keyboard, or
  recording device in hand. Similarly, you should not read from your
  own work. After discussing a problem with another student (or the
  TA!), go watch The Bachelor for a half hour before going back to
  work on the assignment. If you can't remember what the person said
  after a half hour, you didn't really understand it.
</li>
<li>
   Third, everyone in the class is expected to take appropriate
   measures for protecting one's work. For example, you should protect
   your files and printouts from unauthorized access.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that these guidelines are necessarily generalizations and cannot
account for all circumstances. Intellectual dishonesty can end your
career, and it is your responsibility to stay on the right side of the
line.

<p>Examples of cheating include: looking at someone else's program, writing your
program while talking to someone else about it, talking another student through
the solution code, allowing others to look at your solution code, and looking on
the Internet for code to solve your programming assignments, including
stackoverflow and other such sites.  If you have any doubts about what is
allowed, ask the instructor.
<p>
<b>Additionally, if you are repeating the course you may NOT reuse any code or
  assignments.</b>  All submitted work must be new and original.
  <p>
<a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/%7Eaiken/moss/">Plagiarism
detection software</a> will be used on various assignments and
homeworks to find students who have copied code from one another. Any
program that you submit must be yours, and yours alone.
<p>
If you are participating in a pair or group programming assignment and
your partner cheats, you are also culpable. Either you were following
the rules of pair programming and you knew your partner(s) was
cheating, or you were not following the rules of pair programming and
you turned in work as yours that was not.  Note that, "I actually didn't
participate in that project because I was doing x, y, or z instead." is not
considered a valid excuse---instead it is a type of cheating, since you were
then prepared to take credit for work that was not yours.
<p>
Finally, the materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams,
quizzes, and homework assignments are copyright protected works.  Any
unauthorized copying of the class materials is a violation of federal law and
may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student or other
legal action against an outside entity.  Additionally, the sharing of class
materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a
violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic
dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.  This includes,
among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of
sharing those materials with other current or future students.

<!-- uploading course materials to Course Hero or any other such site is
considered collusion and is a violation of the UT Honor Code.  Such actions are
punishable offenses through Student Judicial Services.-->

<p>
<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
<p>
<u>Religious Holy Days</u>: A student who is absent from an
examination or cannot meet an assignment deadline due to the
observance of a religious holy day may take the exam on an alternate
day or submit the assignment up to 24 hours late without penalty, if
proper notice of the planned absence has been given. Notice must be
given at least 14 days prior to the classes which will be missed. For
religious holy days that fall within the first 2 weeks of the
semester, notice should be given on the first day of the
semester. Notice must be personally delivered to the instructor and
signed and dated by the instructor, or sent certified mail. Email
notification will be accepted if received, but a student submitting
email notification must receive email confirmation from the
instructor.
<p>
<u>Students with Disabilities</u>: The University of Texas at Austin
provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact
the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for
Students with Disabilities at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.  Students
requesting accommodations for disabilities must notify the instructor
by the 12th class day.
<p>
