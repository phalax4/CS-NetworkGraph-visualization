<h1>CS343 Exams</h1>

The midterm is based on the reading material for the first half of the
course. The second half is tested in the final, which also requires
high-level synthesis of the material in the whole course.  We will
have a review session before each exam where we will go over the most
important topics.

<p> The best way to prepare for these exams is to keep up with the
reading assignments and attend the class meetings during the semester.
Before each exam, you should then review the material covered in the
class, referring to the reading material whenever necessary. For each
exam there will also be a set of practice questions (<a
href="private/midterm-practice-questions">midterm</a>,
<a
href="private/final-practice-questions">final</a>).
You should make sure you've looked at these questions so that you know
what to expect in the exam. In general, the questions will test
understanding of the main concepts: the motivation behind problems and
techniques, analysis of their successes and shortcomings, etc.  <p>

Cheating is not tolerated and will be dealt with according to the
university policy. The exams are closed book. If you are
more than 30mins late, you won't be able to take the exam.
