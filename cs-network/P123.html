<ul>

    <li> <b>Independent Work</b> - Projects should be completed <i>independently</i> by each student.  
    No collaboration beyond general discussion of the project requirements is
    permitted.

    <li> <b>Due Date/Late Penalties</b> - Projects are due 30 minutes before the start of class on the due date.  Be
    sure to hand in assignments on time, late penalties are a loss of a percentage
    of the original overall points for the assignment: 1 Day: 15%, 2 Days: 40%; 3
    Days: 75%; past 3 days: 100%.  A day is a 24 hour period starting 30 minutes
    before the beginning of class and includes all weekend days and holidays.

    <li> <b>Canvas Submission</b> - Submit all assignment files to the TA electronically using <a href="https://utexas.instructure.com">Canvas</a>.  

    <li> <b>Filename Format</b> -  The filename for each submitted file should have the format:<br/>
    <code>proj[PROJNUM]_[EID]_[LABEL].[EXT]</code> <br/>
    where each bracketed [] item is replaced with the project number, your EID, the label of 
    the submitted file, and the proper extension respectively.  For example, the file name for the project 
    3 report for Jane Doe (EID:jd1234) would be <code>proj3_jd1234_report.pdf</code>.  This example
    will be used throughout the next sections.

    <li> <b>Possible Files to Upload</b> Note: Must upload <b>seperate</b> files to Canvas.  <em><strong>The specific instructions
            for each assignment will specify exactly which files to upload</strong></em> but here are a few examples of files that will likely be required:
    <ol>
        <li><em>Code zip file</em> (<code>[PREFIX]_code.zip</code>, Example: <code>proj3_jd1234_code.zip</code>)
        <ul>
            <li> Should contain <b>only</b> new or modified java code (both *.java and compiled *.class files).</li>
            <li> For example, the command to zip just the modified or new files should be like <br/>
            <code>$ zip proj3_jd1234_code.zip ir/vsr/InvertedIndex.* ir/vsr/MyNewFile.*</code> <br/>
            </li>
            <li> To check your zip file you can run zip list command (<code>unzip -l</code>).  Example output:
            <code style="white-space:pre;">
$ unzip -l proj3_jd1234_code.zip 
Archive:  proj3_jd1234_code.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
    21067  2015-08-24 12:57   ir/vsr/InvertedIndex.java
     7061  2015-08-26 17:25   ir/vsr/MyNewFile.java
     3939  2015-08-26 17:26   ir/vsr/MyNewFile.class
    10049  2015-08-26 17:26   ir/vsr/InvertedIndex.class
---------                     -------
    42116                     4 files
            </code>
            </li>
            <li> Usually, this will only have the <code>ir</code> directory.</li>
            <li><b>NOTE:</b> The zip file should NOT have an upper level directory. For example, the zip file 
            should <b>NOT</b> have extra folders like <code>jd1234_myproj3/ir/vsr/InvertedIndex.java</code> but rather
            the files should simply be in their package folders directly <code>ir/vsr/InvertedIndex.java</code> as in the above zip file example.</li>
            <li> Ideally, your solution should be contained within the classes you wrote and does not modify
            the IR package. </li>
            <li> The code should also be properly commented using Javadoc convention.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>

        <li> <em>Report PDF file</em> (<code>[PREFIX]_report.pdf</code>, Example:  <code>proj3_jd1234_report.pdf</code>) - A short document (1-2 pages) clearly describing in well-written
        English prose, the approach taken to the assignment, the general algorithm
        employed, clear instructions on running the system, and insightful
        discussion of any experimental results obtained. 

        <li> <em> Input/Output trace text files</em> ( <code>[PREFIX]_[TRACESUFFIX].txt</code>, Example: <code>proj3_jd1234_experiment1_trace.txt</code>, 
        NOTE: Each assignment may ask for different trace files so be careful to see the specific assignment instructions) - A detailed trace of 
        your program running on any sample test problems. The traces can be generated
        using the Unix command <code>script</code> (call "man script" for documentation).
        To use script to collect traces, do the following:

        <ol>
            <li>
            Run the script command on the command line: <br/>
            <code>$ script proj3_jd1234_experiment1_trace.txt</code>
            <li> Run the program on different test cases, as you would have
            normally done.
            <li>
            When you want to stop collecting traces, type "Control-D" at
            the command prompt.
            <li>
            The trace of your run is stored in the local file <code>proj3_jd1234_experiment1_trace.txt</code>.
        </ol>

        The script command captures <i>everything</i> printed on the
        terminal, including non-printing characters like carriage returns
        (<tt>^M</tt>) and backspaces (<tt>^H</tt>).  So when you edit the trace
        with a text editor, it may look funny.  <b>If the extra control characters
            do not affect readability of the trace, then you may submit the trace as
            it is.</b>  However, if the trace looks messy, then please re-run your
        program and create a new trace. <br>

    </ol>
    <br/>
    For example, if the assignment requires code, a report and 1 trace file, this is how Canvas should look after submission:<br/>
    <div>
        <img src="canvas-example-submission.png" />
    </div>
</ul>
