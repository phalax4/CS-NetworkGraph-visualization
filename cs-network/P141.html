<p align="center"><u><font size="5">Tips for succeeding in CS 314</font></u></p>

<p align="left">What does it mean to succeed in CS 314?

Obviously, that varies from person to person. Most students define success in

this course as getting an A or maybe a B. I would define success in this course

as mastering the concepts and skills, especially the skills, listed on the
<a href="topicsList.htm">topic

list</a>. If you <i><u><b>master</b></u></i> these things then it will normally follow that you will get

an A or a B.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">How do you master all this stuff? Students always want to know 
what is the one thing I have to do to get a good grade in the course. It seems 
people are always looking for the easy way to do things, the simple answer to 
the problem. You 
could call this the &quot;one switch syndrome.&quot; We like to simplify things because 
the world is so incredibly complex. There is a story in a book about Bill James,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics">a baseball sabermatician</a>, 
how his son had a music box. It had two switches. One was an on - off switch. 
The other was a knob that had to be turned to wind up the box. At 2 years old 
his son didn't understand you had to wind up the box and turn on the on switch. 
He just focused on the on-off switch and when the spring wound down and the 
music box would play when the on switch was on, the boy pronounced the box 
broken. My point is, there isn't <strong>just one thing</strong> you can do to guarantee success in 
CS314, and I suspect this is true of most university level classes. There isn't 
one switch. There isn't one thing you have to do. Instead you have to do <b>a 
whole&nbsp; lot of things.</b></p>

<p align="left">Your final grade in CS 314 is based on 2 things.</p>

<ol>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Performance on clicker questions, programming assignments, and quizzes. Usually 
    35% of 
    final grade</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Performance on tests. Usually 65% of final grade.</li>

</ol>

<p align="left">Your final average will be calculated using your grades on

assignments and tests. Tests may be curved. (See the <a href="../syllabus.htm">syllabus</a> 
for details.) but final averages will not. </p>

<p align="left">If you do not have experience with the

topics of CS 314 such as recursion, data structures, and algorithm analysis, 
that is okay! I teach the class assuming you don't have experience in those 
topics. I teach the class under the assumption that all the students just meet 
the prerequisites of one prior programming class and pre-calculus. Some students 
mistakenly believe they cannot succeed in the class because there are so many 
other students in the class who have more prior programming experience or more 
computer experience and they will get all the good grades. This is absolutely 
false. There are usually a handful of people in each class who have had prior 
programming experience and worked with data structures but this is not a 
necessary or sufficient condition for success in the class. To succeed in the 
class focus on what <u><b>you</b></u> can do <u> <b>now</b></u> and not worry 
about the level of other students in the class.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Here are some of the things you can do to improve your chances 
of success. It is the students who do the following that do the best in the 
class, not the ones with the most prior programming or computer experience.</p>

<ol>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Practice, practice, practice. Programming is not a spectator 
    sport. You don't learn to program by looking at code. You learn to program 
    by programming. The assignments give you lots of chances to program. If you 
    are looking for more problems, <a href="PracticeProblems.htm">see the programming practice page</a>.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Attend lecture.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Take notes in lecture. Instead of sitting and passively

    listening or simply looking at slides force yourself to be active in

    lecture. Take notes. It will help you remember and learn the information

    presented in lecture. I think it is best if you print out the slides and

    bring them to class and annotate them. There are many things said in class

    that are not on the slides!</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Ask questions in lecture. If you do not understand some

    concept or would like to see a different example then <b><u>ask the

    question!</u></b>  <u><b> Do not be afraid to ask questions in class!</b></u>

    Do not be

    cowed by other students into keeping silent if you want to ask me something

    in class concerning the material in the course.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Know how to help yourself. When you get stuck when you are 
    programming learn to look at other coding samples and to search the web for 
    what syntax and runtime errors mean.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Answer questions in class. I often ask questions in class.

    If you have an idea as to the answer, then offer it. Even if you are wrong

    you will learn something and I certainly will not denigrate an incorrect

    answer.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Do the reading from the <a href="../schedule.htm">schedule</a>

    before lecture.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Attend and participate in small group discussion sections.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Do the <a href="../Assignments/index.htm">assignments</a>.

    Even though the assignments are only worth about 20% of your grade that is where

    80% of your learning will take place. Performance on the exam  correlates very closely with performance on assignments.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Start assignments early. Assignments generally go out on 
    Wednesdays. Work

    on them over the weekend. If you finish, great. If not you will have put in

    some work and will be ready to seek help on Monday. I have also found that 
    if you get stuck on a problem it is very useful to step away from the 
    problem for a day. Your mind tends to work on the problem self consciously 
    and when you come back to the problem you often have a fresh perspective. 
    You will only have the chance to step away from a problem if you start 
    early. If an assignment is due Thursday and you start Wednesday night, that 
    doesn't give you much to to step away if need be.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Make sure the work on your assignments is your own. You

    could certainly go on an Easter egg hunt and search the web for code that

    can be used on assignments and I might not detect it, but that is going to

    do a very poor job of preparing you for the exams which are worth about 65% of

    your final grade. Further, most of the points on the exams are tied to

    programming and problem solving questions. If you have not done much

    programming or problem solving you&nbsp; will not do well on the exams.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Follow the <a href="../Assignments/index.htm">general 
    assignment guidelines</a>. It is very easy for the graders to take off points for style

    errors. They are easy to spot, so follow the coding standards.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Do not sit down at the computer to start and assignment. Do

    not simply sit down and start coding an assignment.&nbsp;Work it out on

    paper first. Have a plan. Have a design. Think about your problem and a

    solution before you ever touch the computer.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Work with a partner on pair programming assignments.. You do 
    not have to do all the programs alone. Work with a partner and by that I 
    mean actual sit down together and do the program together. You might write 
    up parts separately, but sit down together at one computer to enter and test 
    the code. </li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Study for exams. Most of my old exams are<a href="../../cs307/TestsStudyMaterial.htm">

    posted to the web</a> so there are plenty of study materials. Work the old

    exams on your own and meet with a study group to review solutions and

    answers. Do not simply look at suggested solutions. Work out the problems on

    your own! This and doing the assignments probably has more impact than

    anything else on how you do on exams.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Seek help whenever you have a question. Being willing to

    seek help early has a big impact on your performance in the class. There are

    vast number of resources to help answer your questions in this class including:

    <ol type="a">

      <li>

        <p align="left">the class discussion group on Piazza. Again, set aside your fears and post

        questions you have to the discussion group, read other people's posts, and provide

        answers to other people's questions</li>

      <li>

        <p align="left">your programming partner on pair assignments</li>

      <li>

        <p align="left">your Teaching Assistant, via email, in section, or during

        their office hours</li>

      <li>

        <p align="left">the instructor's lab hours. Do not be afraid to come

        to me for help</li>

      <li>

        <p align="left">the web page. Almost any handout you need can be had via

        the web page</li>

      <li>

        <p align="left">tutoring via the ACM and the UT learning center</li>

    </ol>

  </li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Be organized. Maintain copies of slides, assignments, your

    code, old tests, the schedule, the syllabus, the class coding standards, in

    a binder.</li>

  <li>

    <p align="left">Do these things now! The time to do something about your

    grade is now, during the semester. At the end of the term there is nothing

    that can done to change your grade, other than the correction of

    administrative errors.</li>

</ol>
