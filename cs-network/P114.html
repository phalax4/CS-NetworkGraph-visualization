<h2><b>Discussion Section Problem Set 7<br></b></h2>
<h3><b> Due in Section on Friday, October 27, 2017 </h3></b>
</center>
The problem set must be completed before section and brought to section.  To
ensure that your problem set is turned in correctly and that you receive credit
for discussion section, you must follow these guidelines exactly.

<ul>
<li>Include the following header at the top of your file:
<pre>
Discussion Section Problem Set #: 
Student Name:
EID:
CS login:
Email address:
Unique Number: 
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>You may either type your answers or write them by hand, but you must bring a
  hard copy to discussion section.
  </li>
<p>
<li>
   In discussion section, your TA will check that you make a good effort on the
problem set and that you are participating in the discussions in section and
ready and able to answer when called upon.  If all of those are true, you will
receive credit for discussion section that day.  Note that a "good effort" on
the problem set includes that all answers are in your own words and <i>not</i>
copied from anywhere else, including the slide deck.
</li>

<!--Number One--->
<li>
In some operating systems, I/O from/to disk is done directly to/from a
buffer in the user program's memory.  The user program does a system
call specifying the address and length of the buffer (the length must
be a multiple of the disk record size).
<p>
The disk controller needs a physical memory address not a virtual
address.  Your co-worker proposes that when the user does a write
system call, the operating system should check that the user's virtual
address is valid, translate it into a physical address, and pass that
address and the length (also checked for validity) to the disk
hardware.
<p>
This won't quite work. <b>In no more than two sentences,</b>
what did your co-worker forget?
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Two--->
<li>
Pooh Software Ltd. is selling a file system that
uses a UNIX-like file system with multi-level indexing. For more reliability,
the inode array is actually replicated on the disk in two different places.
The intent is that if one or a group of sectors that are storing either
replica of the array become bad, the system can always recover from the
replica. Discuss the effect of having this replicated data structure on
performance.
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Three--->
<li>
In Unix, the pipe(2) function call creates an I/O mechanism
called a pipe and returns two file descriptors, fd[0] and fd[1]. The
files associated with fd[0] and fd[1] are streams of data and are both
opened for reading and writing. Suppose pipe always returns the two
lowest-numbered file descriptors in the process's file descriptor
table that are unused. Assume that initially fdt[], the file
descriptor table, has three open entries: fdt[0] is the default input
device, fdt[1] is the default output device and fdt[2] is the default
error output device; all other entries of the fdt are NULL. What does
the fdt look like after each of the five following commands is
executed in sequence by the process?<br>
<br>
1: pipe (&amp;fd[0]);<br>
2: close(fd[0]);<br>
3: close(1);<br>
4: dup(fd[1]);<br>
5: close(fd[1]);
<p>
When might such a sequence of commands be useful?  <p>You'll need to use
the man pages for pipe, close, and dup to answer this question.

<!--Number Four--->
<li>
Belady's anomaly: Intuitively, it seems that the more frames the
    memory has, the fewer page faults a program will get.
    Surprisingly enough, this is not always true. Belady (1969)
    discovered an example in which FIFO page replacement causes more
    faults with four page frames than with three. This strange
    situation has become known as Belady's anomaly.  To illustrate, a
    program with five virtual pages numbered from 0 to 4 references
    its pages in the order:

    <br>0 1 2 3 0 1 4 0 1 2 3 4

    <ol>

        <li> Using FIFO replacement and assuming demand paging, compute
        the number of page faults with 3 frames. Repeat for 4 frames.

        <li>
        Compute the number of page faults under LRU, the clock
        algorithm, and the optimal algorithm.  What do you notice?

    </ol>
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Five--->
<li>
Disk requests come into the disk driver for tracks 10, 22, 20, 2, 40,
6, and 38, in that order.  A seek takes 6 msec per track moved.  How
much seek time is needed for the following scheduling algorithms?<br>

a) FIFO <br>b) SSTF <br>c) LOOK (SCAN, but doesn't move to the end)
<br>In all cases, the arm is initially at track 20, and you may assume
that the head is traveling towards higher numbers.<br><br> <i>Adapted
