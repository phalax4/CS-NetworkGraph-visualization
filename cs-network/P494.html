<P>
<A href="http://www.iclicker.com/"><B>iClicker:</B></A>
Each student is required to buy/rent an iClicker (any version of iClicker
device; not iClicker GO app).  This will be used for attendance
and to reinforce and practice with the class material.  Two iClicker
points are given just for voting, and an additional point is given
for a correct answer.  Most iClicker questions and answers are online at
<a href="cs314clindex.html"><B>Clicker Questions</B></a>, and it is
okay to review them in advance.  The clicker scores will be converted
to a grade by making the highest student score at least 108 and
linearly scaling other scores; this gives some extra points to account
for minor illness, forgotten or malfunctioning clicker, etc.  Adjustments
to clicker scores will only be made for significant causes such as
major illness.  Bringing another student's clicker to class is
considered to be cheating.
<P>
<B>Programming assignments</B> will mainly be done in Java, with
options to do some in Lisp.
Program files may be provided for use with the assignments, in the
directory <tt>/projects/cs314/</tt> or
in the <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/cs314/">
FTP directory for Program Files,</a>
<tt>ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/cs314/</tt>, &nbsp;
and in <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/cs314/">
<tt>http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/cs314/</tt></a>. &nbsp;
<!-- The files are described by

It is legal to use any of these files as part of your programs.

<P>
<H4>Grading:</H4>
<P>
Grades are kept on
<A href="https://utexas.instructure.com">Canvas.</A>
It is <B>your responsibility</B> to check your grades often to
make sure that your assignments have been received and graded.
<P>
Course grades are assigned on the scale A = 93-100, A- = 90-93,
B+ = 87-90, B = 83-87, B- = 80-83, etc.
provided that the Final Exam grade is at least 65; if the Final Exam
grade is below 65, a lower course grade may be assigned at the
instructor's discretion.  Grades are averaged using the following weights:
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>Clicker Participation </TD><TD> 10% </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Midterm Exam </TD><TD> 20% </TD>
  <TD>Tuesday, October 24, in class</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Final Exam </TD><TD> 30% </TD>
  <TD>Thursday, December 14, 9-12 AM</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Programming Assignments </TD><TD> 40%</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
There will be a
10% per day late penalty for late programming assignments up to 4 days;
no late assignments will be accepted after 4 days.  It is the <B>student's
responsibility</B> to submit assignments correctly using Canvas.
<P>
<B>Programming projects must be your own individual work.</B>  Students may
discuss concepts or help with specific problems in another student's code.
However, sharing code constitutes plagiarism.
The Moss program will sometimes be used
to detect duplicated programs.  It is not possible to pass the course
without doing the programming assignments.
