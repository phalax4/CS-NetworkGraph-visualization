<!--Number One--->
  <li>
	In the <tt>Quizzes</tt> category on Canvas, you will find a quiz titled,
"Academic Integrity Quiz".  Complete that quiz.  Multiple attempts are
permitted, but you must eventually get all questions right in order to receive
credit for your homework.  <br> <br> <i>Thanks to John Thywissen, who created
this quiz and its accompanying presentation.</i>

</li>
<p>
<!---Number Two--->
<li>
In the <tt>Quizzes</tt> category on Canvas, you will find a quiz titled, "C and
Linux Quiz and OS Concept Inventory".  You are only allowed one attempt at this
quiz, but it is graded only for completion.  The C and Linux questions we are
hoping you know, but there will be a review during the first discussion section
next week.   The OS Concept Inventory questions may be entirely new, and that's
okay.   You'll learn the answers over the course of the semester.
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Three--->
<li>
Please review the <a href="../code_of_conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> for the 
course.  Print it out, sign indicating that you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct, and submit to any TA or Alison at office hours during the week of 9/5.</li>
<p>
<!--Number Four--->
<li>
On the course website, navigate to the syllabus.  Once you have found the
syllabus, find the section on pair programming, and read the paper "All I Really
Need to Know about Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarten".  After reading
that paper, write a seven sentence summary that contains all major points of the
paper.
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Five--->
<li>
Write a linked list in C.  You may choose the development environment of
your choice, but we highly recommend you choose an editor on Linux
(<tt>vi</tt>, <tt>emacs</tt>, <tt>sublime</tt>, ...) and compile
using <tt>gcc</tt>.  (See the course home page for a brief introduction
to <tt>gcc</tt>.)
  <p>
	Your linked list nodes should be made of C structs, and each should contain
an integer (the data) and pointers to the next and previous nodes.  Your program
should create a default list with 5 sorted nodes containing integers 1-5 and
also implement <tt>add()</tt> and <tt>remove()</tt> methods.  The <tt>add()</tt>
method should insert a new node in sorted order.  The <tt>remove()</tt> method
should remove a node.
<p>
  How you test and design this code is up to you.   There are no requirements
  about dedicated head/tail nodes or not, etc.  Turn in your solution by
  cut-and-pasting it into a text file with the rest of your homework and
  submitting it on Canvas.
