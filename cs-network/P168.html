<p>My name is Sarah Abraham, and I am an assistant adjunct at the University of 
Texas at Austin in the Department of Computer Science.  For my dissertation, I  worked with Don Fussell in the high performance computer graphics lab with an interest in non-photorealistic rendering, and intuitive simulation-based tools for artists.
</p>
<p>
My other interest is video game design and programming.  Video games fascinate me as both an artistic and entertainment medium, and I am very inspired by the film makers Andrei Tarkovsky, Akira Kurosawa, and Yuri Norstein, as well as the philosophy and humanity of the 19th Century Russian writers such as Lev Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky.  I believe video games can foster greater cooperation and empathy, and I am exploring this through my company, <a href="http://www.akula-games.com">Akula Games</a>.

<h3>Akula Games</h3>
<a href="http://www.akula-games.com">Akula Games</a> started as an experiment in mobile development, but we are currently working on our first PC title, <a href="http://www.akula-games.com/skazka/"><i>Skakza</i></a>.  You can learn more about this development process through our blog, <a href="http://www.akula-games.com/blog">Tale of Tales</a>.
<p>
We also are developing educational curriculum for K-12 by using game development as a platform for critical reasoning and mastering material.  You can learn more about this initiative at <a href="http://www.akula-games.com/education">Akula Games: Education</a>.
