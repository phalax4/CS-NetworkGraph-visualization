<h2>Project 3 for CS 371R: Information Retrieval and Web Search <br>
Web Spidering and PageRanking<br>
</h2>
Due: Tuesday Nov. 14, 2017<br>
(Making web page: Part 1 due: Nov. 7;&nbsp; Part 2 due: Nov. 9)<br>
</center>
<br>
<h3>Existing Spiders </h3>
<p> As discussed in class, a basic system for
spidering the web is available in <code>/u/mooney/ir-code/ir/webutils/</code>
See the <a href="../doc/ir/webutils/package-summary.html">Javadoc </a>
for this
code. Use the <a
 href="../doc/ir/webutils/Spider.html#main%28java.lang.String%5B%5D%29">
<code>main</code> method </a> for the <a
 href="../doc/ir/webutils/Spider.html">
<code>Spider</code></a> class to start from a particular URL and spider
the web
breadth-first and save the documents in a specified directory for
subsequent
indexing and searching with VSR. Also see the specializations <a
 href="../doc/ir/webutils/SiteSpider.html"> <code>SiteSpider</code></a>
and <a href="../doc/ir/webutils/DirectorySpider.html">
<code>DirectorySpider</code></a>, which restrict their crawling to a
particular
site (host) or directory, respectively.
</p>
<p>See a <a href="../spider-trace.txt">sample trace</a> of running
<code>SiteSpider</code> on the UT CS department faculty page to collect
75 pages related to CS faculty.
</p>
<p>This assignment will not require using the "<code>-safe</code>"
spidering flag
that invokes restrictions according to the
<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html">Robot Exclusion
Policy</a> since we will be sticking to spidering within the
department. Therefore
the <code>Safe</code>* and <code>Robot</code>* classes can be ignored
for now. However, if you spider outside the department, be sure to use
"<code>-safe</code>". 
</p>
<p>A collection of 800 department pages <code>SiteSpider</code>ed from <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/faculty">
<code>http://www.cs.utexas.edu/faculty</code></a> are cached in
<code>/u/mooney/ir-code/corpora/cs-faculty/</code>. Like
<code>dmoz-science</code>, this directory can be indexed and searched using
VSR, as in <a href="../proj1/">Project 1</a>. This database can also be
searched using the <a href="../search.html">Simple Search Engine</a> servlet
demo. The code for this servlet is available at
<code>/u/mooney/ir-code/irs/</code> ("irs" is for "information retrieval
servlets").
</p>
<h3>Your Task</h3>
<p>
Your assignment is to make a specialization of the <code>Spider</code>
class called <code>PageRankSpider</code> that computes the PageRanks
of the spidered pages based on their link structure, and make a
specialization of the <code>InvertedIndex </code>class
called <span style="font-family:
monospace;">PageRankInvertedIndex</span> that utilizes the PageRanks
to compute the relevance of documents. Make sure to override only the
methods you change. You should also create further a
specialization <code>PageRankSiteSpider</code> that restricts its
spidering accordingly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>While crawling, <code>PageRankSpider</code> should form a graph
based on the incoming and outgoing links. When computing PageRank, only those pages which are actually
indexed (saved to disk) should be included in the graph as nodes. You may find <code>ir.webutils.Graph</code>
and <code>ir.webutils.Node</code> data structures helpful for building and manipulating the graph. 
Then it should run the PageRank algorithm on the graph and store all the PageRanks in a text file named 
<code>page_ranks.txt</code> in the same directory as the crawled pages.  The format of <code>page_ranks.txt</code> should be like this example:

<pre class='codesample'>
P001.html 0.006494458532952974
P002.html 0.009569125239295519
P003.html 0.006569776377162855
</pre>

Each line contains a file name, a single space, and then computed PageRank for that document.<br><br>

With respect to the PageRank algorithm's parameters, use 0.15 for <em>alpha</em> and 50 for the number of <em>iterations</em>. <br>
</p>
<p>
 You can crawl the following URL to help you verify that your PageRank algorithm works:
 <pre class="codesample"> <a href="a.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/ir-course/proj3/a.html</a> </pre>
</p>
<p><code></code>In addition to indexing the documents, <code>PageRankInvertedIndex</code> should read the
PageRanks of the documents from the <code>page_ranks.txt</code> file described above. When computing the relevance of the document for a
 query it should add its PageRank scaled by a <em>weight</em> parameter to the score.  The <em>weight</em> parameter should be a command
 line argument for <code>PageRankInvertedIndex</code> specified with "<code>-weight value"</code> </p>


<p><strong>Making Web Pages (Parts 1 and 2)</strong><br>
</p>
<p>As discussed in class, in order to create test data for this
assignment, everyone
should create a special personal page for this class at
<code>http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/<i>login</i>/ir-course.html</code>
by adding an
"<code>ir-course.html</code>" file to the <code>/u/<i>login</i>/public_html/</code>
web
directory for your <code><i>login</i></code>.  You might need to set the Linux permissions to make the 
file readable with the command <code>chmod a+r ir-course.html</code>.  Make sure that when you paste your
URL into your web browser, it pulls up your new web page.<br>
</p>
<strong>Important: Parts 1 and 2 of this assignment cannot be turned in late!</strong>  
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part 1 (2.5 points): due Nov.  7</span><br>
You should include links to at least 5 webpages
of the courses that you have enjoyed from the list of CS courses
located at <a href="course-list.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moooney/ir-course/proj3/course-list.html</a>.
Please include the links <b>exactly</b> as they are given in this
list, and don't
worry if your favorite class is not included - we are just creating a
toy link
structure. For example, your "<code>ir-course.html</code>" may look
like <a href="favorite.txt">this example</a> (Or <a href="favorite.html">the example as a webpage</a>).<br>
This simple part counts for 2.5% of
the project grade. They all will be linked from <a
 href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/students.html">
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/students.html</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Submission instructions for Part 1:</em></strong> Submit a single file on Canvas under the assignment 
"Project 3 - Part 1 (Webpage)".  The file should be named <code>[PREFIX]_link.txt</code> (e.g. <code>proj3_jd1234_link.txt</code>)
and only have your URL on the first line like so:
<pre class='codesample'>
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/jd1234/ir-course.html
</pre>

</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Part 2 (2.5 points): due Nov. 9</span><br>
Once all ir-course.html pages are in place by Nov. 7, select at least
3 <code>ir-course.html</code> pages of other students and link them
from your page. You may use
some criteria like how much you agree with their favorite courses.
Again, the bottom-line is to make an interesting toy link structure.
This part counts  2.5% of the project grade. Do
not change your page after Nov 8.<br>
NOTE: This portion will not have a separate submission, we will just use your
webpage to grade. <br>

<br/>
<p><strong>Crawling, indexing and searching the webpages (Part 3)</strong><br>
<p>Use your <code>PageRankSiteSpider</code> to crawl from&nbsp; <a
 href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/students.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/students.html</a>
and index all student course pages. Use a limit of 200 pages. 
<!-- Your <code>PageRankSiteSpider</code> trace file should have the same options as <a href="proj3_spider_trace.txt">this spider solution trace file</a></p> -->
<p>
Index and search the resulting directory of pages using <code>PageRankInvertedIndex</code>
and compare the search results for the following 
values of <span style="font-style: italic;">weight</span>: {0.0, 5.0, 10.0}. 
Note that a weight of 0 should be the same as the original InvertedIndex. Try the
following queries:
<ul>
<li> software </li>
<li> security </li>
<li> privacy </li>
</ul>
 Your <code>PageRankInvertedIndex</code> trace file should have the same weighting and queries as <a href="proj3_retrieve_trace.txt">this trace solution trace file</a>.
</p>
<p>
You should submit <strong>two</strong> trace files of the spidering and the queries as described in the submission section below.
</p>

<h3>Report and Trace Files</h3>
<p>
In your report, describe the PageRank algorithm as you have implemented it, and describe how you changed the retrieval process to incorporate it.  Additionally, try several queries to get a feel for the effects of PageRank and then answer at least these two questions 
  <ol>
    <li>Does PageRank seem to have an effect on the quality of your results, as compared to the original retrieval code?  Why or why not?</li>  
    <li>How does varying <em>weight</em> change your results?  Why do you think it changes in this way?</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
(<em>You
    should explicitly answer these questions, i.e. in your report put "Q1. Does..?" 
    and then give the answer underneath so that we do not have to search for your answers.</em> <strong>Make sure to explain your answer rather than just state it.</strong>): 
  
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>
In submitting your solution, follow the general course instructions on
<a href="../proj-submit-info.html">submitting projects</a> on the course homepage.  Along with that, follow these specific instructions for Project 3:
