<h2><b>Discussion Section Problem Set 6<br></b></h2>
<h3><b> Due in Section on Friday, October 19, 2017 </h3></b>
</center>
The problem set must be completed before section and brought to section.  To
ensure that your problem set is turned in correctly and that you receive credit
for discussion section, you must follow these guidelines exactly.

<ul>
<li>Include the following header at the top of your file:
<pre>
Discussion Section Problem Set #: 
Student Name:
EID:
CS login:
Email address:
Unique Number: 
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>You may either type your answers or write them by hand, but you must bring a
  hard copy to discussion section.
  </li>
<p>
<li>
   In discussion section, your TA will check that you make a good effort on the
problem set and that you are participating in the discussions in section and
ready and able to answer when called upon.  If all of those are true, you will
receive credit for discussion section that day.  Note that a "good effort" on
the problem set includes that all answers are in your own words and <i>not</i>
copied from anywhere else, including the slide deck.
</li>
</ul>

<!--Number One--->
<li>
Pages have (at least) the following three bits associated with them:
the resident bit, the clock/reference bit, and the dirty bit.
Describe each bit and its use.
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Two--->
<li>
What causes a page fault?  What is the end result for the running
process?
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Three--->
<li>
Sam P. Hacker is a Head Guru in a software company known for
operating systems with very sorry quality. Hacker suggested a trick to
reduce the pressure on the swap space. Instead of swapping out pages
that belong to code texts into the swap area, the operating system
could just take away the memory frames. If the code page is needed
later, it could be paged directly from its binary file. Hacker's
argument is that the operating system will save time by not storing
the code page into the swap space, and will save space in the swap
area. The code text exists on disk anyway, and could be fetched from
there. Would you approve of this design? Why or why not?

<!--Number Four--->
<li>
Question 9.19, page 852 in the Second Edition, page 880 in the Third Edition, B&amp;O.

<!---Number Five--->
<li>
In a 32-bit machine we subdivide the virtual address into 4 segments
as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER WIDTH="40%" >
        <tr>
            <td>
                <center>10-bit</center>
            </td>

            <td>
                <center>8-bit</center>
            </td>

            <td>
                <center>6-bit</center>
            </td>

            <td>
                <center>8 bit</center>
            </td>
        </tr>
</table></center> We use a 3-level page table, such that the first
10-bits are for the first level and so on.

<ol>
    <li>
    What is the page size in such a system?
    <li>
    What is the size of a page table for a process that has 256K of
    memory starting at address 0?
</ol>
