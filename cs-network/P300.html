<H2>How to Succeed in CS 429</H2>

Having taught CS429 for several semesters, I have some insights into
who succeeds and who fails in this class.  By "success" I mean more
than getting a passing grade.  I mean really learning the material
that you'll need, immediately, to do well in CS439.  But also what
you'll need to be a competent computer scientist.<P>

CS429 is a challenging class.  But it can be an enjoyable class if you
make it so. 

<H3>Keep Up.</h3> 

Many of you are very smart and coasted through high school and your
first few semesters here without having to work very hard.  This may
just be the course where that strategy fails you.<P>

The content of this course comes at you like a firehose.  You have to
work diligently to keep up.  If you blow off a couple of weeks, you
may never catch up.<p> 

<H3>Keep in Touch.</h3> 

If you have some emergency or situation that negatively impacts your
performance in the class, let me know right away.  I've had students
come to me during the final week of classes and say something like: "I
haven't been to class for the past two months because my grandmother
died."  I'm going to say: "You didn't have access to a phone or email
or a friend who could let me know?"  You have to take responsibility
for your own success or failure. 

<H3>Come to Class.</h3> 

I have noticed that there is a direct correlation between class
attendance and success in the class.  Since attendance is not required
and the slides and textbook material are all available, some students
find it tempting to try to get the material outside class.  For some
folks, that works.  For most, it doesn't.  Decide for yourself.<p>

<H3>When You Come to Class, Pay Attention.</h3> 

In class we'll be going over most of what you'll need to do well on
tests and labs. If you spend the entire class playing games, surfing
the web, or talking to your friend, you might as well stay home.
Also, you're very likely distracting everyone around you, and me.
So <i>keep your phone and laptop closed during class.</i>

<H3>Read/Work Carefully.</h3> 

Many points are lost on tests because the student answered the
question they was expecting, and not the one actually asked.  Read the
questions carefully.  Then, if you don't understand the question, ask
for an explanation!<P>

Read assignments carefully.  The TAs and I get really tired of
answering questions on Piazza that are answered in the assignment
write-up.  After you've read the assignment carefully, if you still
don't understand, then ask. <P>

Read due dates carefully.  If you wait until the last day to start an
assignment, that's not our fault.  You'll have some slip days, but
after they are used up, they are gone and you won't get any more.
Schedule your time accordingly.<P>

Every semester, I get messages from students saying: "I turned it in 5
minutes after midnight.  Can it be counted on time?"  If you have two
weeks for an assignment and still miss the deadline, it's almost
certainly because you didn't start early enough.  If it's late, it's
late.<P>

Checking on many of our assignments is automated.  Often someone will
post on Piazza a message like: "The checker says my program is wrong,
but I'm certain it's right."  Check it again;  your program is almost
certainly wrong, even if you don't think so!

<H3>If you Need a Certain Grade, Earn It.</h3> 

At the end of each semester, I always have students come to me with
one of the following pleas:
<UL>
<li> I need a B- in this course to continue in CS.
<li> If I fail this class for the second time, I'll be kicked out of CS.
<li> If I fail this course I'll lose my scholarship, my parents will
  kill me, my life will be ruined, etc.
<li> (Much less often) I have a 4.0 average and I need an A in this class
  to keep it. 
</ul>
The next question is always: Can you give me some extra work to raise
my grade?  I would love to help, but it's illegal and unethical for me
to offer an opportunity to one student that I don't offer to everyone
in the class.  The TAs and I have plenty to do without making up
an extra credit assignment.  So please don't ask. <P>

If you need to receive a certain grade in the class to preserve your
standing in the department, in the university, or in your
family <i>earn it during the semester.</i>  At the end of the
semester, it's too late.<P>

By the way, if you're failing this class for the second time, consider
whether you really have the interest, drive and competence to be a
computer scientist.  There are plenty of other majors out there that
may be more satisfying and more suitable for you.  If you're majoring
in CS to please your parents or someone else, you're probably in the
wrong major.<P>

<H3>There's always a highest B.</h3>

I assign you a letter grade at the end of the semester based on a
numerical average I computed from your work throughout the semester.
To do that, I use the percentages listed in the course syllabus.  The
numerical average that divides an A from an A-, say, is also listed in
the syllabus.  I do reserve the right to be more generous in setting
that boundary, based on the number of students in each range.  For
example, I may decide that there should be more A's and lower the
threshold for obtaining an A from that in the syllabus.  I will never
raise the threshold.  This means that you know at the beginning of the
semester what average you need to <i>guarantee</i> yourself an A.<P>

But there will always be some student with the lowest average assigned
an A and some other student with the highest average assigned an A-.
If you are the second of those, this does not qualify as unfair to
you.  So please don't ask me to raise your grade because you were
only, say, 2 points away from an A.  If you need an A, work hard
during the semester to ensure that you're above the published
threshold.  If you are, you're guaranteed an A in the class.  If not,
your strong desire to get an A or your urgent need for an A won't be a
factor.<P>

<H3>Don't cheat.</h3>

Whatever else you do, make sure that you understand acceptable
standards of behavior on labs, homeworks, tests, etc. and follow them.
If you're caught cheating, you will certainly fail the class and be
reported to the Dean's office.  It is better, by far, for you to get a
low grade on a test or assignment than to be caught cheating.<P>

Don't imagine that you won't be caught.  Every semester, students are
shocked at how good we are at detecting cheating.<P>

Don't publish your work in any publicly available place, including
GitHub.  If you do and someone copies it, you are both responsible.
If you want to share your work with potential employers use BitBucket
or other services that support private repositories.  Those allow you
to give access selectively.<P>
