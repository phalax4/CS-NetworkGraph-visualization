<h3>Class Announcements</h3>

Below are links to the course announcement, syllabus, and homework
assignments.  Additional information will incrementally appear during
the semester.

<p>
Everytime you start to work, check this page!  This Webpage and the
Webpages with the URL prefix
"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/hunt/class/2014-fall/cs429/" that are
transitively reachable from this Webpage are the definitive resource
for assignments, laboratories, and other class-related issues.  There
are some pointers outside of this URL prefix.  For instance, Piazza is
referenced, and this discussion forum is not part of the definitive
source of class-related information.<P>

To the best of our current knowledge, the <b>final exams</b> are: 
<ul>
<li> Young's class:  Friday, December 12, 9am-noon, JES A121A
<li> Hunt's class:   Monday, December 15, 2-5pm, FAC 21 
</ul>
You should probably confirm this for yourself at the UT Registrar's website.<P>

<h4>Fair Warning: There will be a quiz this week (week of 11/17), given in the
discussion sections.</h4>

<p>
<h4>
<blockquote>
<i>Important Comment for Laboratory 2B:</i> There is a discrepancy
between the book's version of MRMOVL and that of the ACL2-based class
programming tools.  For unknown reasons, we changed the assembler and
simulator from what is shown in the book on page 338 to work as if
RegA is the source register pointer and that RegB is the destination
register.  In fact, if you make a syntactic mistake when coding the
MRMOVL instruction, you will see that the usage of RegA and RegB is
swapped.  That is, the implementation of the MRMOVL instruction
updates target register RegB with the contents of the address
specified by adding displacement D to the contents of RegA.

<br><br>
rm32( D + contents(RegA) ) -> RegB
<br><br>

Note, this instruction was not used on the exam, so you would not have
made a mistake decoding this instruction on the exam.  But, this may
have confused your programming if you choose to use this instruction
for your laboratory. It was not necessary to use this instruction for
Laboratory 2A. However, you will need this instruction to implement
the "block copy" routine in Laboratory 2B.  Please consider this issue
carefully, and use the semantics shown just above (different than in
the textbook) to implement your Laboratory 2B solution.

<h3>
The current schedule has separate discussion sections for Hunt and
Young on Fridays at 9am and at 2pm.  We have decided to consolidate
these.  This requires bigger rooms. So beginning tomorrow (9/5) and
for the rest of the semester, the two Friday discussion sections from
9-11am will both meet from 9-11am in CLA 1.104 and the two discussion
sections from 2-4pm will both meet from 2-4pm in BUR 112.  Note that
this change will not appear in the course schedule, so note these room
changes.

<h3>
You may download the
practice <a href="./homework/quiz-y86-code.lsp">problem</a> I gave
out in class as a study problem for our exam.
</h3>

<p>
Problem 3.55 is like problem 3.12, which has a solution in the back of
Chapter 3.  Problem 3.12 concerns unsigned numbers while problem 3.55
concerns signed numbers.

<p>
Problem 3.56 requires precision -- very carefully track updates.

<p>
Problem 3.61 concerns changing the code in Figure 3.29 so that one
fewer register is required by the compiled code.  If achieved, then
the compiled code may become more efficient.  Think about redundancy
among the variables.

<p>
Exam preparation comment: Remember what I have said -- I test "right
at" the material presented in class and what you have been doing for
your homework and laboratories.  Thus, a good exam preparation
approach is to make sure that you can work problems like those you
have been assigned.


Optional extra credit -- will replace third-lowest homework grade.

Describe, in two pages, what the utility of the information presented
in the course will be for you.  You must submit your writeup in ASCII,
and ONLY ASCII.  Non-ASCII submissions will be ignored -- use only the
characters with character code 10 (Newline) and codes from 32 through
126, inclusive.  6000 characters maximum.  Submission by 11:59 pm on
December 2, 2012.  Note, last year five submissions did not meet these
requirements, and, thus, were not graded.

Our review session for the final exam will be held in the Jackson
Geo-sciences Building (JGB) 2.216 on Saturday, December 3, 2011, from
1:00 to 3:00 pm.

<h3>
The final exam is open book, open notes -- just like all of the
exams in this course.  The final exam refers to a problem in the
book, so I encourage you to bring your copy of the class textbook.
You may not use any electronic device during the exam.
