      <b>Assignments in CS314: </b>If you took  CS312, one difference 
      in programming assignments is you will not always write complete programs. You will often, but not always, be given a partial program and 
    have to complete it. You will do a lot of  coding to &quot;spec&quot;, that is coding 
    to specification; the program will have already been designed and you must 
    implement it given the design. You will have to develop algorithms on your 
    own, but the specification of methods are already be complete. Many of the methods you write
      <b>won't</b> ask the user for input or do any output. The &quot;input&quot; to the 
      methods will be via parameters and the &quot;output &quot; will be the return value. 
      Of course you can add user input and output in a method that calls the 
      specified method to provide a way of interactively testing the methods you 
      write. Remember: &quot;Testing 
      Rocks, Debugging Sucks&quot;<br>

<p><b>1. Hamming Distance:</b> &quot;The Hamming distance between two strings of equal 
length is the number of positions for which the corresponding symbols are 
different. Put another way, it measures the number of <i>substitutions</i> 
required to change one into the other, or the number of <i>errors</i> that 
transformed one string into the other.&quot;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">From the Wikipedia 
article on Hamming Distance</a>. For this problem you will be working with 
arrays of ints instead of String objects. </p>

<p align="left">

<code>/* Determine the Hamming distance between two arrays of ints. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; pre: aList != null, bList != null, aList.length == bList.length<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; post: return the Hamming Distance between the two arrays of ints.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither the parameter aList or bList are altered as a result of this method.<br>
*/ <br>
public static int hammingDistance(int[] aList, int[] bList){</code></p>

<p align="left">

For example given the array {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1} and the array {1, 2, <b>
8</b>, 4, 5, 4, 3, <b>5</b>, 1} the Hamming distance is 2. </p>

<p><b>2. isPermutation:</b> This method determines if one int array is a permutation 
of another int array.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;A permutation, also called an "arrangement number" or "order " is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list S into a one-to-one correspondence with S itself.&quot;

[mathworld.wolfram.com] For example the list {1, 2} has the following permutations;

{1, 2} and {2, 1}.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Note the elements of listA and listB are lists, not sets, so

duplicate items could appear. So for example given the list {1, 2, 2} the unique

permutations are {1, 2, 2}, {2, 1, 2}, and {2, 2, 1}. {2, 1} is not a

permutation of {1, 2, 2}., Another example of lists that are not

permutations of each other: {2, 1,&nbsp; 1} is not a permutation of {2, 2, 1}. </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Courier New"><code>/* Determine if listA is a 
permutation of listB. </code></font><code>&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </code><font face="Courier New"><code>pre: listA != null, listB != null<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; post: return true if listB is  a permutation of listA, false

otherwise.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither listA or listB are altered as a result of this method.<br>

*/<br>

public static boolean isPermutation(int[] listA, int[] listB)</code></font><code>
</code> </p>

<p align="left"><b>Hint:</b> Do not try to solve the problem by taking one the 
arrays and generating all the permutations of that array and then check to see 
if the other array is one of those permutations. That is  too inefficient 
except for arrays with a very small number of items.</p>

<p align="left"><b>3. mostVowels:</b> On method <code>mostVowels</code> you can 
use any and all parts of the String class and native arrays.</p>

    <p align="left">The <code>mostVowels</code> methods takes in an array of Strings as a 
    parameter and determines which String has the most vowels.</p>
    <p align="left">For this method vowels are the characters 'A', 'a', 'E', 
    'e', 'I', 'i',&nbsp; 'O', 'o', 'U', and 
        'u'. The method is <u>not</u> trying to determine which String has the 
        largest number of distinct vowels. Thus &quot;aaaaaa&quot; has more vowels that &quot;aeiou&quot;. 
        The String &quot;aaaaaa&quot; has 6 vowels while the String &quot;aeiou&quot; only has 5 vowels. You 
        can use whatever String methods you want when completing this method.</p>
    <p>
<code>/* Determine the index of the String that has the largest number of vowels. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vowels are defined as  'A', 'a', 'E', 'e', 'I', 'i', 'O', 'o', 'U', 
and 'u'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The parameter list is not altered as a result of this method.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; pre: list != null, list.length &gt; 0, there is an least 1 
non null element in list<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; post: return the index of the non-null element in list that has the largest number of characters that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; vowels. If there is a tie return the index closest to zero. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The empty String, &quot;&quot;, has zero vowels. It is possible for the maximum number of vowels to be 0.<br>
*/<br>
public static int mostVowels(String[] list)</code><p><b>4. sharedBirthdays: </b>The birthday problem is a question where most people's intuition is proved 
incorrect 
by mathematics. The problem is: Given a group of N people, how large must N be 
so that there is a 50% chance that at least 2 of the N people have the same 
birthday?<code> </code>
    </p>
    <p>
Write a method with two parameters, the number of people in a group and the 
number of days in the year. The method will generate random birthdays for the 
number of people and then determine how many pairs of people have the same 
birthday. You don't have to generate actual days of the year for the birthdays. 
You can simply use ints. 
    <p>
Here are two ways to generate random ints in Java. One uses an object of type
<code>Random</code> and the other uses the <code>random</code> method from the
<code>Math</code> class. 
    <p>
<code>// fist approach<br>
Random r = new Random();<br>
int max = 10;<br>
int x = r.nextInt(max);<br>
// x will now hold a value between 0 and 9 inclusive.<br>
// The distribution of values in uniform.</code><p>
<code>// second approach<br>
int max = 10;<br>
int x = (int) (Math.random() * max);<br>
// x will now hold a value between 0 and 9 inclusive.<br>
// The distribution of values in uniform.</code><p>
If three people (Olivia, Kelly, Isabelle) share the same birthday, that is 3 
pairs of people:<ul>
  <li>pair 1: Olivia and Kelly</li>
  <li>pair 2: Olivia and Isabelle</li>
  <li>pair 3: Kelly and Isabelle</li>
  </ul>
    <p><code>/* Perform an experiment simulating the birthday problem. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick random birthdays for the given number of people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    randomly assigning birthdays.<br>

    public static int sharedBirthdays(int numPeople, int numDaysInYear) {</code></p>
    <p>
<b>After completing the method run the following experiments:</b><p>
Perform 1,000,000 experiments with 365 days per year and 182 people per 
experiment . What is the 
average number of pairs of people with shared birthdays? (Write a method to automate this 
experiment and put the code in CodeCamp.java.). Include your answer in a comment at the top of your 
CodeCampTester.java program.<p>
How many people do you think it takes so there is a 50% chance that at least 2 
of the people have a shared birthday in a 365 day year?<p>
Perform 50,000 experiments with 365 days per year and vary the number of people 
from 2 to 100. 50,000 runs with 365 days, and 2 people, 50,000 runs with 365 
days and 3 people, ... 50,000 runs with 365 days and 100 people. Total of 4,950,000 runs, 50,000 
runs per experiments * 99 experiments = 4,950,000 runs. For each of the given number of people 
determine the percentage of experiments where at least one pair of people shared 
a birthday. At what number of people (between 2 and 100) does the 
percentage first exceed 50%? Does the answer surprise you? How did it compare to 
your predicted answer?<p>
Include a table in a comment in your CodeCampTester.java program with the results of this experiment 
using the following format::<p><b><code>Num people: 2, number of experiments with one or more shared 
birthday: 120, percentage: 0.24<br>
.....<br>
Num people: 100, number of experiments with one or more shared birthday: 50000 , 
percentage: 100.00</code></b></p>
<p>At the top of the table state how many people it requires to have a 50% 
chance of there being at least 1 shared birthday, given a 365 day year.</p>

comment, but do not include any code that calls your methods that perform these 
experiements.</b></p>
<p><b>5. queensAreSafe: </b>There is a chess

and programming problem called the 8 queens problem. The goal is to place eight queens on a chess board so that none of them may attack any other queen.  That is, no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.

In chess a queen may move any number of spaces straight up, down, left, right,

or along any of the 4 diagonals. In the method you are completing the board is 
square (same number of rows as columns) but is not necessarily 8 by 8.</p>
<p align="left">Consider the following board:<p align="left">
        <img border="0" src="../../images/oneQueenOnbaord.gif" width="374" height="314"><p align="left">A

queen's position is designated with the Q. The red arrows show the squares that

queen can attack. Thus if there were a queen in any of those squares this would

be an unsafe board. So the following set up is unsafe.<p align="left">
