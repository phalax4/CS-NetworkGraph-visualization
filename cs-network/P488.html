1. Assume that the corruption detection protocol that uses parity bits in 
Section 8.1 is used to detect corruption in a block that has 15 data bits and 
5 parity bits. Will corruption, where all the bits in such a block are 
corrupted, be detected? Explain your answer.

Solution: 

No, corruption can not be detected.

In this case, m=3 and n=5. Because all the bits in a block are corrupted,
each column has four corrupted bits. Thus, the parity bit in each column
can not detect corruption in this column.
