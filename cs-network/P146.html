<p align="left"><b>Programming Assignments: </b>Individual assignments are to be 
completed on your own. You may not share solution code or experiment code with other students or other 
programmers. Review the class policy on improper collaboration from the class
<a href="../syllabus.htm">syllabus</a> and how this applies to individual assignments. </p>







    <p>A few of the assignments may be done in pairs using a technique called
    <a href="../../cs307/handouts/papers/Pair-Prog-CACM-1999.pdf">pair programming (Read 
    the paper on pair programming to understand how the technique works.)</a>. 
    Turn in one solution&nbsp; for the pair. (Submit the assignment to one 
    partners Canvas account.) Once you start working with a 
    partner on an assignment you may not switch partners. If you do not wish to 
    work with a partner after starting on an assignment you must both complete 
    it individually. You must inform your TA(s) via email if you start working 
    on an assignment with another person and decide to finish as individuals. 
    You may not re-pair after starting the assignment with someone else. You may 
    NOT 
    start working on on your own and then start working with another person. When 
    working on pair programming assignments you are expected to spend at least 
    80% of your time on the assignment working with your partner, together at 
    one computer, taking terms typing, and navigating. </p>







    <p><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">If you are retaking CS314 you 
    must start from scratch on assignments unless you worked alone on the 
    assignment in previous semesters and are working alone this semester. You 
    may not reuse code from a partner from previous semesters and you may not 
    use code you created in a previous semester with a partner this semester.</span></b></p>
    <p><b>Programs must be written in Java, using the Java 2 Platform Standard 
    Edition 8.0</b>. See the <a href="../../cs307/software.htm">software page</a> 
    for information on downloading and installing Java at home.</p>







<p>Assignments are due by 11pm on the due date.,</p>







<p>You  have 6 free late (slip) days in 1 day units (1 second&nbsp; to 24 hours = 
1 day) for the semester. </p>







    <ul>
      <li>You may divide your slip days across the assignments in any way you 
      wish to extend deadlines for the assignments except you may not use more 
      than 2 slip days&nbsp;on a single assignment for assignments 1 - 11. <b>
      <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">No slip days may be used on the 
      assignment 11.</span></b></li>
      <li>On pair programming assignments (See above for more information), both 
      members of a pair use their own slip days, and both must have the 
      required number of slip days. If both students do not have the required 
      number of slip days it is a 0 for both students.</li>
      <li>You may not use slip days to turn an assignment back in for a 
      re-grade.</li>
      <li>Weekends and vacation days do not stop the slip day clock. For example 
      if an assignment is due on Thursday the last day you may turn it in is the 
      Saturday just after the due date.</li>
      <li>If you turn in an assignment late and do not have the required number 
      of slip days, the assignment score is 0.</li>
      <li>To help the TA track your slip-day status you will complete the slip 
      day portion of the appropriate comment in your source code file you turn 
      in.</li>
    </ul>







<p>Unless prohibited by the assignment handout, you <u><b>may</b></u> use any component of the language or 
standard library up to Java level 8.0. (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/">The 
Java API</a>). </p>







<p><b>Assignments must compile and run from the command line in the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/public-labs">GDC Microlab</a>. 
When testing and grading your program we will use the CS department Linux 
machines and the command line. We will not use any particular IDE. To ensure 
your programs work you can transfer your source code (.java files) to your CS 
department account and then compile and run them from the command line. See
<a href="../handouts/SSH%20Guidelines.pdf">this page</a> for 
more help.</b></p>







<p><a name="AssignmentFormats"></a>Assignments will require you to turn in 
multiple files. You will turn in a single zip file that contains all required 
files. <u><b>This must be a flat zip file with no internal directory structure</b></u>.&nbsp;
<b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Assignments that are not in the correct 
format or not named correctly will be penalized as described below.</span></b></p>







<p>Assignments must be turned in via Canvas and must be turned in under the 
correct assignment. You must turn in a file with the correct name and in the 
proper format. </p>







<p>If you do not follow the instructions and specifications for assignments 
(name, where to turn in, zip file format) you cause extra work for the graders 
and myself. As a student and potential software developer you must follow 
instructions and specifications. When you fail to follow 
instructions it causes you to become a special case.  </p>







<p>Realize there are hundreds 
of students in this course and only a few TAs. We use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripts</a> 
to streamline some aspects of grading. Failure to follow the assignment 
instructions and specifications causes these scripts to fail and the graders 
must spend more time on your submission. The following penalties are in place 
because there must be consequences for failure to follow instructions.
<a href="../../cs307/handouts/followingInstructions.htm">Please read this account of a 
student who has seen the issue from both sides</a>.</p>







<p><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">If you fail to follow the instructions for turning in assignments you will 
likely lose all points. Specific penalties for failure to follow instructions and specifications on 
assignments: </span></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>







    <ul>
		<li>Classes must be in the default&nbsp; (no package statement) unless 
      otherwise specified. You will lose 10 points (all correctness points) if you put a package statement 
      in your program. </li>
		<li>An assignment that does not compile or does not run, loses all 
      correctness points. You will lose correctness points because you program will 
      not compile. You must follow all instructions for the assignment so that 
      our automated testing framework can compile, run, and test your program. 
      This include naming the Java class correctly. </li>
		<li>Your program must work using Java version 8 as installed on the CS 
		department machines.</li>
		<li>There may be multiple versions of your program on your computer. We 
      will grade what you turn in. If you turn in the wrong file (for example 
      the original shell provided by the instructor with no changes) your grade 
      will suffer accordingly. Most likely a 0. (Screen shots with time stamps 
      of &quot;last modified&quot; from your system 
      are proof of nothing. It is trivial to change the system time on 
      computers or to Photoshop &quot;evidence&quot;.) Likewise if we ask for the source code, the .java file, and 
      you turn in the .class file your grade will be 0.</li>
		<li>You must add the header and fill it in for every file you turn in or 
	  you may lose points.</li>
		<li>You may not use disallowed classes, methods, or programming constructs. You lose 2 points 
      per occurrence.</li>
		<li><b>On pair assignment if you do not correctly add the header 
      information for each student only the student that turns in the assignment 
      will get credit.</b></li>
</ul>







<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assignments grades are <b>not</b> scaled to effort or time spent working on them. (You may 
spend a large amount of time working on an assignment and still lose many points 
because your program is not correct.) The programs are 
not graded on a strictly linear scale. Points are deducted for failed test 
cases, poor style, poor efficiency, lack of necessary comments, convoluted 
algorithms, lack of student provided test cases, lack of answers to questions 
regarding the assignment, and other reasons deemed appropriate by the 
instructor. </p>







<p>Assignments will be checked for plagiarism and copying using

<a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">Moss</a>. You may discuss 
high level design issues with your fellow students, but sharing algorithms or 
code or obtaining solutions from another source constitutes academic dishonesty 
and will result in an F for the course. 
<a href="../../cs312/syllabus.htm#Collaboration">Review the class policy on cheating.</a></p>







    <p>The teaching staff will grade, comment, return, and post the grade for an 
    assignment within 6 days. A grade can only be disputed within the following 
    5 days. (This isn't a weekend bazaar. If there is an error in your grade you 
    have one week to contact your grader. We won't go back at the end of 
    the term to look at an assignment from early in the term.)  </p>







    <p><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Please do not ask for a 
    regrade lightly. Your grade could in fact go down as a result of the 
    regrade. Do not quibble over a few points. Regrades are for serious issues. 
    In the past the vast majority of regrades have resulted in no change in the 
    grade or a lower grade.</span></b></p>







    <p>Please contact your 
    TA&nbsp; if you assignment is not graded in a timely and accurate 
    fashion. </p>

    <p>All grade disputes must be made in writing by email to the grader with 
    supporting evidence and will result in the entire assignment being re-graded 
    which may result in a lower grade.<hr>
<p><b>Testing: </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Testing your solutions is an important part of programming. </li>
      <li>I will provide some tests with each assignment, some of which may 
      contain errors.</li>
      <li>You will create additional test cases for it. Programs will be graded 
      using additional test cases created by the teaching staff. </li>
      <li>I encourage you to use the Piazza discussion group to address which 
      tests of mine are incorrect and to share tests you write to test each 
      others programs. <b>Note, the test cases you turn in must be ones you 
      wrote yourself. You may not copy other students' test cases to turn in. 
      Only for further testing of your solution.</b></li>
      <li>Tests may be posted to the class discussion group on Piazza. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Assignments will be checked for correctness with more tests generated by the 
    instructional&nbsp; staff. Your assignment may pass all the provided tests 
    and still be incorrect. Grading test cases will not be published. If 
    you would like to see the test specific test cases your code failed on you 
    must meet with your TA during their office hours to see the test cases.<hr>
<p><b>Design, Program Hygiene, Style, and Documentation </b></p>
<p><b>Goal: We have program hygiene guidelines so we have readable, maintainable 
code. Some guidelines are tens of pages or more. Out goal is to encourage good 
program hygiene, without being overly prescriptive. </b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use  if statements that throw exceptions to check for preconditions and post conditions on all public methods.</li>
  <li>Use methods and parameters to replace redundant / repeated code.</li>
  <li>Make instance variables within classes <font face="Courier New">private.</font></li>
  <li>Do not use <font face="Courier New">static</font> data as a form of 

    global variables.</li>
  <li>Break up long methods (over 25 lines of code or so) into smaller methods.</li>
  <li>Use consistent tabbing /spacing to make you code easier to understand and 
  follow. There are some auto indentation features in eclipse, google it. </li>
  <li>Use a consistent brace style to make your code easier to understand and 
  follow.</li>
  <li>Include white space to make your code easier to understand and follow</li>
  <li>Limit the scope of variables to the smallest reasonable scope possible</li>
  <li>Give sensible names to your classes, method names and variable names. 
  Follow
  <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5-naming">these naming conventions</a>.. 
  <br>
  Good advice also at this site:
  <a href="http://geosoft.no/development/javastyle.html#Naming%20Conventions">http://geosoft.no/development/javastyle.html#Naming%20Conventions</a></li>
  <li>Use descriptive variable names where appropriate. Consider the following 
  example (from a style guide for a similar course at Stanford.)<br>
  <br>
  <b>BAD VARIABLE NAMES:</b> <br>
  <code>public String Spork(int x, String y) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int pizkwat = mumboJumbo(y);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (pizkwat &lt; x)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y = y.substring(0, pizkwat);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y = y.substring(0, maxChars);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return y;<br>
  }<br>
  <br>
  </code><b>GOOD VARIABLE NAMES:<br>
  </b><code>public String void breakWordAtSpace(int maxChars, String toChop) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int firstSpace = findFirstSpaceInString(toChop);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (firstSpace &lt; maxChars)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toChop = toChop.substring(0, 
  firstSpace);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toChop = toChop.substring(0, maxChars);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return toChop;<br>
  }<br>
&nbsp;</code></li>
  <li>Comment every class and method </li>
  <li>For class comments, describe what the class does or any special properties 
  of the class.</li>
  <li>For method comments this is the expected format /* &lt;What the method does, 
  preferably in one line&gt; /* &lt;Describe each input parameters/arguments of the 
  method, also in one line&gt; /* &lt;Describe what the method returns&gt;</li>
  <li>Comment your code inside methods as necessary. (Complicated algorithms or 
  sections of code should be commented. What seems obvious to you will not be 
  obvious to others. Comments should summarize what is going on, not restate the 
  obvious.)</li>
  <li>Use assertions to check your logic in your code.</li>
  <li>IN CS314, avoid the use of the break and continue keywords. There are times these can be 
  useful, but most beginning programmers misuse them. The use of break 
  especially indicates you have spread the exit conditions for your loops like 
  dust in the wind instead of placing them at the start of the loop.</li>
  <li>Don't use &quot;raw types&quot; for data structures with parameterized types. 
  Example always specify <code>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list </code>or appropriate 
  type. Don't use <code>ArrayList list</code>.</li>
  <li>Initialize instance variables in constructors as necessary. (using default 
  values is okay). Avoid initializing instance variables in the declaration 
  statement.</li>
</ul>

</p>
  <hr>
  <p><b>Efficiency: </b>Worry about this last, but your program should run as 
  fast as possible and use as little memory as possible within the constraints 
  of the assignment. Some tests will be based on the length of time it takes 
  your solution to complete and you may fail a test if your solution takes too 
  long.</p>
