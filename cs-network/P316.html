Each of us thrives if the community thrives. Each of us thus  has an individual responsibility to strive, not just for our own goals,  but for the goals of the larger community. In this document, a group of  the faculty have laid out a set of ground rules designed to make our  department the kind of community in which we all want to live. If a  professor in one of your classes has pointed you here, you should view  this document as part of the syllabus for that class.</p>
<h3>As a Student, What You Can Expect from Your Department</h3>
<p><strong>The CS Curriculum</strong></p>
<p>The faculty as a whole have the responsibility to formulate a  curriculum that will prepare you for a lifetime of work in the field of  computing. Yes, some of what you learn will get you a job right away.  Some of what you learn may seem more esoteric and less essential. But  remember that the faculty have lived through a lot of changes in the  field. They've all had to learn new ideas, new programming languages,  new architectures, and new applications many times (and without the aid  of classes or textbooks). They've got a lot of first-hand understanding  of the fundamental concepts that make it easiest to adapt as new things  come along. Trust a bit and take advantage of this expertise. Try to  like every class you take.</p>
<p><strong>Each Class that You Take</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing that each of your teachers should give you  is a guided tour through the subject matter of the class. After all,  you can go to the bookstore, buy books, read them, and write some code  without ever signing up for a class. But, whenever you do sign up for a  class, you have the right to expect that the instructor has read a lot  of books, solved a lot of problems, and then chosen, from all of that  material, 14 weeks of the most important ideas presented in the clearest  fashion.</p>
<p>You have the right to expect that every instructor will show up for class on time and be prepared to conduct the class.</p>
<p><strong>Responsiveness from the Instructional Staff</strong></p>
<p>In most of your CS classes, you will have an instructor, one or  more TAs, and possibly a set of proctors. This group of people, working  as a team, has the responsibility to do everything they can to help you  learn.</p>
<p>Your instructor, TAs, and proctors should treat you with respect and encourage you to seek help when you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Grades</strong></p>
<p>Publication of the Grading Policy: You have a right to be told,  within the first four days of the semester, how grades in each class  will be determined. You will be told what the basis of the grade will be  and how much weight will be assigned to each component of the grade. In  some classes, you may be told even more, for example, what numeric  scores will be assigned what letter grades. But keep in mind that this  isn't always possible. Classes that use different exams each semester  may have very different score distributions from one semester to the  next so it isn't possible to know in advance what thresholds make sense.</p>
<ul><li> Fairness: You have a right to expect that grades will be  assigned fairly. Every student who turns in the same quality of work  will receive the same grade.</li>
<li> Feedback: You have a right to see your graded work and to understand what, if anything, was wrong with the work you submitted.</li>
<li>
<p>Punctuality: You have a right to expect that exams and  assignments will be graded in a timely fashion. It's hard to be more  specific on this since the amount of time required to do a good job of  grading depends so heavily on the kind of work and the staffing level of  the class. One concrete thing you should expect is that you will have  gotten some substantive feedback on your performance in each class  before the Q drop deadline.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>As a Student, What the Department Can Expect from You</h3>
<p><strong>Academic Honesty</strong></p>
<p>The University and the Department are committed to preserving the  reputation of your degree. It means a lot to you. In order to guarantee  that every degree means what it says it means, we must enforce a strict  policy that guarantees that the work that you turn in is your own and  that the grades you receive measure your personal achievements in your  classes:</p>
<p>Every piece of work that you turn in with your name on it must be  yours and yours alone unless explicitly allowed by an instructor in a  particular class. Specifically, unless otherwise authorized by an  instructor:</p>
<ul><li> Students may not discuss their work with anyone except the  instructor and other members of the instructional staff (TA, Section  Leader or Lab Proctor).</li>
<li> Students may not acquire from any source (e.g., another  student or an internet site) a partial or complete solution to a problem  or project that has been assigned.</li>
</ul><p>You are responsible for complying with this policy in two ways:</p>
<ol><li>You must not turn in work that is not yours, except as expressly permitted by the instructor of each course.</li>
<li>You must take all reasonable precautions to prevent your work from  being stolen.  It is important that you do nothing 	that would enable  someone else to turn in work that is not theirs.  Do not share your work  with anyone else.  Make sure that you adequately protect all your  files.  Even after you have finished a class, do not share your work or  published answers with the students who come after you.  They need to do  their work on their own.</li>
</ol><p>IMPORTANT: The penalty for academic dishonesty will be a course grade  of F and a referral of the case to the Dean of Students Office. Further  penalties, including suspension or expulsion from the University may be  imposed by that office.</p>
<p>One final word: This policy is not intended to discourage students  from learning from each other, nor is it unmindful of the fact that most  significant work in computer science and in the computing industry is  done by teams of people working together. But, because of our need to  assign individual grades, we are forced to impose an otherwise  artificial requirement for individual work. In some classes, it is  possible to allow and even encourage collaboration in ways that do not  interfere with the instructor's ability to assign grades. In these  cases, your instructor will make clear to you exactly what kinds of  collaboration are allowed for that class.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance at Classes and Exams</strong></p>
<p>Specific policies on class attendance will be set by individual instructors. Make sure you follow those policies.</p>
<p>Whether you come to class or not, you are responsible for keeping  up with what happens in class. If you miss a class (other than for  illness or an emergency), it is not reasonable for you to expect your  instructor or TA to repeat just for you the material that was covered in  the class that you missed. This applies both to the content of the  class as well as to announcements about class policies, events,  deadlines, or whatever.</p>
<p>Final examination schedules are published at the time of  preregistration. If you are making end-of-semester travel plans, make  sure that you will still be here to take each of your finals at the  scheduled time. Travel plans are not a valid reason for missing an exam  or asking for a special exam time.</p>
<p>The policy on makeup exams will be set by individual  instructors. Sometimes a makeup will be allowed, but many times it will  not be. Except for emergencies, you must take each exam at its scheduled  time unless you have made prior arrangements with the instructor. Keep  in mind that is often difficult or impossible for an instructor to  create a separate makeup exam that is guaranteed to be of equal  difficulty as the regular exam.</p>
<p>Demands of a job or job interviewing are never valid reasons for missing a class (or a deadline or an exam).</p>
<p><strong>Classroom Behavior</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to learn in every class you attend. But you  have the responsibility to help assure that every other student shares  that right. Specifically:</p>
<ul><li> Come to class on time. Do not leave early. These things  are very disruptive. Recognize that the buses and the parking space  situation are unpredictable elements and allow for that. If you must  come late or leave early (for example because of a doctor's  appointment), let the instructor know in advance.</li>
<li> Don't be disruptive during class. Don't chat with your neighbor or rustle the newspaper.</li>
<li> Don't allow your electronic devices to be disruptive. Turn off your cell phone, beeper, and watch alarm.</li>
<li> Participate.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Academic Work outside the Classroom</strong></p>
<p>The only way to learn computer science is to do it. You should  plan to spend a substantial amount of time outside the classroom working  on each class that you take. For some classes, that will mean  programming. For others, it may mean reading, studying, working  problems, writing, or whatever. Don't let this work slide. It will not  generally be possible either to do a programming project or learn the  material in a theoretical class the night before the due date or the  exam. You should be working on your own every week of the semester.</p>
<p>A deadline is a deadline. Each instructor will publish the class  policy for turning in late work. Plan your work accordingly. Don't push  the deadlines and don't expect the instructor to do anything other than  what has been published. Even five minutes is "late". Your instructor  can't just acquiesce and accept your project five minutes late. Then  what about seven or ten or fifteen or thirty? What about the other  students in the class who had to miss some other event in order to get  their work in on time? Is it fair to them to accept your work late? No.  Plan that the printer will be down and the busses will be late on the  day your assignment is due. Don't cut it down to the wire. And, if you  do, accept the published consequences with grace.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty and Staff Interaction</strong></p>
<p>Your instructor, plus any TAs and/or proctors assigned to your class  will work as a team to help you learn. But you need to interact with  them in a reasonable way. Specifically:</p>
<ol><li> Remember that the instructional staff are a team. They will not all  do everything. The instructor will tell you who will be responsible for  what. Respect that. If you ask the wrong person your question, you  probably won't get a reasonable answer and you will waste their time as  well as yours. For many kinds of questions it really is better to ask  the TAs or the proctors. This is particularly true of nitty gritty  questions that arise in the labs, since the TAs and proctors are likely  to spend more time there than the instructor does. It's their job.</li>
<li> The University's electronic mail policy recognizes email  as an effective way for your instructor and TAs to inform you about  important things that may be happening in class. You are responsible  for:
<ul><li> Making sure that your instructor has a valid email  address for you. If you do not want to use the one that the university  has on record, then make sure to give your instructor another one.</li>
<li> Reading your email every day.</li>
<li> Guaranteeing that your mailbox does not overflow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Excuses such as, "My email box was full", "I don't use that email  address any more", "I was too busy to check my email", "I was on an  interview trip and couldn't check my email", or "My computer crashed and  all of my email was destroyed" aren't acceptable.</li>
<li>Email is also a very valuable way for you to communicate  with your instructor and TAs. But be sure you use it appropriately.  Specifically:
<ul><li> Using email, it's easy to ask a question or make a  comment that you'd never make in person. Be careful about this. If you  think that what you're about to say wouldn't be something you'd feel  comfortable going to office hours to say, you probably shouldn't say it  in email either.</li>
<li> In particular, do not send email to your  instructor (or anyone else for that matter) when you're angry. You'll  regret it when you calm down and you'll have antagonized someone who is  important to you.</li>
<li> Remember that the instructor has a permanent record of every email message.</li>
<li> Feel free to use email to ask questions about  projects and homework assignments. But keep in mind that, although email  is available, neither the instructors or the TAs are responsible for  replying to email the instant it is sent. Don't wait until the last  minute before something is due to ask your questions. Also, keep in mind  that, if you ask a question that has a nontrivial answer, it may not  make sense for the instructor or TA to write a small book for you.  Sometimes it will be reasonable for them to ask you either to bring the  question to class or to come to office hours to discuss it.</li>
<li> Although it's easy for you to dash off an email  question, it takes time for the instructor or the TA to answer it. Don't  ask questions to which you can find the answer somewhere else. For  example, don't write to your instructor to ask where the regularly  scheduled final exam is. (It's on the Registrar's web site.) Don't write  and ask how much the first midterm counts. (It should be on the class  syllabus.) Don't ask what happened in a class that you missed (unless  you had an emergency).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Office hours are there for you to use. You can expect that the  person who is teaching your class loves the material and wants to share  it with anyone who will listen. If you have questions about what's been  covered in class or you're interested in finding out more about  something, go to office hours and ask. You'll probably find that it's  hard to get the faculty to shut up. The one thing that most faculty hate  is students who only come to office hours to ask questions about  grades. If there's been a mistake in grading your work, of course, go  and ask (see below). But think twice before you go to office hours to  ask questions that give the impression that you care less about learning  than you do about grades. A few other points to keep in mind about  office hours:
<ul><li> If you can't make it to regularly scheduled office  hours, ask for an appointment. But don't leave this to the day before  the exam. It may not be possible to find a suitable time on such short  notice.</li>
<li> Again, remember the team concept. The faculty and TAs  for your class will try to schedule their office hours to cover as wide a  range of times as possible. If you can't make it to one person's office  hours, try someone else's.</li>
<li> Unless an office door is already open, knock first and don't go in until you're invited to do so.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p><strong>Grades</strong></p>
<p>Grades are a necessary evil. You don't like worrying about  grades and the faculty hate having to assign them. We'd all rather focus  on the content of our classes. But your degree is a commitment from the  University that you have achieved a certain level of expertise in the  classes you've taken, so we need some way to measure that. To make this  process work, you need to understand:</p>
<ul><li> The grade you are given, either on an individual exam or  assignment or as your final grade, is not the starting point of a  negotiation. It is your grade unless a concrete error has been made. Do  not go to see your instructor or your TA to ask for a better grade  because you want one or you "feel you deserve it". Go only if you can  document a specific error in grading or in recording your scores.</li>
<li> Your grade is a reflection of only one thing: how well did you  do in the class. Nonacademic circumstances have no bearing on your  grade. Don't go to see your instructor and explain how important a  better grade is in your life. It would be unfair to other students and  it would undermine the meaning of the degree if the instructor responded  to such issues.</li>
<li>If you believe that an error has been made in grading your work,  you have one week from the time that the work was returned to the class  to file a complaint in writing to your instructor. Note that this is  one week from the time that the instructor made the work available to  the class. If you missed class and didn't get your work until later,  there is no extension of the one week deadline. If you decide to submit a  complaint about the grading of your work, make sure to describe the  issue clearly and return the original work and your note to your  instructor.</li>
<li> Errors can certainly be made in grading. But keep in mind that  the errors can be made either in your favor or not. So it's possible  that if you ask to have a piece of work regraded your grade will go down  rather than up.</li>
<li> Remember that the most important characteristic of any grading  scheme is that it be scrupulously fair to everyone in the class. Keep  this in mind if you're thinking of asking, for example, for more partial  credit points on a problem. The important thing is not the exact number  of points that were taken off for each kind of mistake. The important  thing is that that number was the same for everyone. So it can't be  changed once the grading is done and the papers have been returned.</li>
<li> You instructor will decide what it takes to get an A or a B or a  C or D in the class. Deciding the boundary cases is always hard. Your  instructor is under no obligation to make score cutoffs public or to  tell you how far away your were from the next higher grade.</li>
