<P>

<H3> Addressing: </H3>
Consider the following declarations:
<PRE>
     type complex = record  re, im: real  end;

          person  = record name:     alfa;
                           age:      integer;
                           location: complex;
                           weight:   real;
                           salary:   real     end;

     var  people = array [ 7..14, (austin, dallas, houston)]
                          of person;
</PRE>

<UL>
<LI> Assuming <TT>integer</TT> and <TT>boolean</TT> are 4 bytes, and
<TT>alfa</TT>, pointers and <TT>real</TT> are 8 bytes,
how much storage is occupied by the array <TT>people</TT>?

<LI> Calculate the effective address of the expression:
<PRE>
   people[10,dallas].location.im
</PRE>
Show how it was derived and give the <TT>aref</TT> form.
</UL>

<H3> Other Questions:</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Show how an operator precedence parser would parse the string:
<PRE>
     A - (B / C - D) / E + F
</PRE>
Show the contents of the stacks at each step; produce a tree as output.

<LI> Give one advantage and one disadvantage of hashing as a method
of symbol table organization.

<LI> Consider the regular expression <TT> (a | b)*b+b* </TT> .
What is the simplest regular expression that denotes the same language?

<LI> Give the allowable form of productions for a Regular grammar.

<LI> Consider the following grammar:
<PRE>
 S  -->  a S
 S  -->  S b
 S  -->  b
</PRE>

<UL>
<LI> What kind of grammar is this in the Chomsky hierarchy?
<LI> What kind of language does it denote?
<LI> Is there a simpler kind of grammar that denotes the same language?
If so, give the grammar; if not, explain why not.
</UL>

<LI> Briefly and clearly define the following terms: ...  8 terms chosen
from the vocabulary list on the study guide.
</UL>
