<A href="http://www.iclicker.com/"><B>iClicker:</B></A>
Each student is required to buy/rent an iClicker (any version of iClicker
device; not iClicker GO app).  This will be used for attendance
and to reinforce and practice with the class material.  Two iClicker
points are given just for voting, and an additional point is given
for a correct answer.  Most iClicker questions and answers are online at
<a href="cs375clcontents.html"><B>Clicker Questions</B></a>, and it is
okay to review them in advance.  The clicker scores will be converted
to a grade by making the highest student score at least 108 and
linearly scaling other scores; this gives some extra points to account
for minor illness, forgotten or malfunctioning clicker, etc.
Bringing another student's clicker to class is considered to be cheating.

<H3> Course Description:</H3>
<P>
CS 375 covers the design of Compilers, which translate programming
languages that are easy for humans to use (Java, C++, etc.) into the
difficult-to-understand machine language that is executed by computer
hardware.  Because machine language is the <I>only</I> language that
can actually be executed, the compiler, along with the operating
system, is one of the central pieces of systems software that makes
computers usable.
<P>
This course will cover the full range of compiler topics.  Each student
will write a real compiler for most of the Pascal programming language,
producing machine code that we will run on hardware.  This compiler is an
excellent capstone project for a degree in Computer Science: it is a
large project that produces an industrial-scale software product.
Algorithms, Data Structures, Programming Languages, Architecture,
and Theory are
combined in a compiler, so this course brings together the courses
of the undergraduate CS curriculum into a coherent whole.
<P>
By the end of the course, the student will have completed a significant
<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_passage">rite of passage</A>
and have the confidence of having written a major component of systems
software.
<P>
The course covers the major parts of a compiler, in the order in
which they operate in the compiler itself:
<UL>
<LI> <B>Lexical Analyzer:</B> The Lexical Analyzer or Lexer reads
characters from the
input file and groups the characters into words or <I>tokens</I> in
internal form: keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators.
<LI> <B>Parser:</B> The Parser receives a linear sequence of tokens from
the Lexer and combines them into structured sentences
in the form of <I>abstract syntax trees</I> or <I>ASTs</I>.
<LI> <B>Semantics:</B> Semantic (meaning) processing includes type
checking and generation of code to access data structures such as arrays,
pointers and records.
<LI> <B>Optimization:</B> The efficiency of the code produced by the
compiler can be dramatically improved by optimization.  The optimizer
makes use of concepts from CS theory such as graph theory and set theory.
<LI> <B>Code Generation:</B> This is the final stage, in which actual
machine code is generated.  Theory is used here too, e.g. graph coloring
to map the program onto machine resources such as registers.
<LI> <B>Advanced Topics:</B> The course will include the topics of
object-oriented programming, partial evaluation, translation between
programming languages, pattern matching, just-in-time compilation, Lisp,
and parsing English.

<H2> Grading Policies:</H2>
<!--  
Q-drop after February 11 will be given only for good cause.
   -->
<P>
Grades are kept on
<A href="https://utexas.instructure.com">Canvas.</A>
It is <B>your responsibility</B> to check your grades often to
make sure that your assignments have been received and graded.
<P>
Course grades are assigned on the scale A = 93-100, A- = 90-93,
B+ = 87-90, B = 83-87, B- = 80-83, etc.
provided that the Final Exam grade is at least 65; if the Final Exam
grade is below 65, a lower course grade may be assigned at the
instructor's discretion.  Grades are averaged using the following weights:
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>Midterm Exam </TD><TD> 20% </TD><TD></TD>
  <TD> Tuesday, October 31, in class</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Final Exam </TD><TD> 30% </TD><TD></TD><TD>Monday, December 18, 9-12 AM</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Clicker Participation</TD><TD> 10% </TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Programming Assignments: </TD><TD>  </TD><TD></TD>
  <TD>(10% per day late penalty)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Lexical Analyzer           </TD><TD> 06% </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Lexical Analyzer using <TT>lex</TT> </TD><TD> 04% </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Parser (total of 3 parts)  </TD><TD> 18% </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Code Generator             </TD><TD> 12% </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
All students must complete all exams and programming assignments.
This course has a <B> very heavy programming load,
especially in Summer</B>; students should not take other
classes or work while taking CS 375 in Summer.  
<P>
<B>Programming projects must be your own individual work.</B>  Students may
discuss concepts or help with specific problems in another student's
code.  However, sharing code, working together on program design or
flowcharts, or reading someone else's code is not allowed.  All code
that is given in the class directory may be used as part of
your programs.
<P>

<!--  
Programs may be assigned letter grades, which are numerically averaged
as A+ = 100, A = 95, A- = 93, B+ = 88, etc.  A program that just satisfies
the assignment and has no errors will typically be given a grade of A-;
grades of A and A+ are given to programs that have something extra,
such as extra work (e.g., in optimization) or especially nice code.
Note, however, that a grade of A- is  averaged several points higher
than the bottom of the A range; for example, a student who made 93
on both exams and received A- on all programs would have an average
of 93 and receive a grade of A.
