<b>Course Objectives</b>

<p>

This is an introductory course on the major topics in the areas of
image synthesis, interactive techniques, geometric modeling, and
computer-based animation.  The material covered includes
<ul>
<li> OpenGL programming
<li> principles of operation of raster graphics systems
<li> sampling and antialiasing
<li> homogeneous coordinate transformation techniques
<li> parallel and central projection and perspective transformations
<li> hidden surface removal
<li> light and reflectance models for local and global illumination
<li> shading techniques
<li> ray tracing
<li> basic object modeling techniques
<li> visual perception and basic color theory
<li> hierarchical modeling.
<li> basic animation
</ul>

<p>

Upon course completion, you should have mastered both the mathematical
principles of these techniques and their implementation.
Implementation of these techniques will be demonstrated through a
series of programming assignments in C++, in many cases using OpenGL.
Your mastery of the mathematical fundamentals will be exercised
through written homework and exams.

<p>

<B>Student Evaluation</B>
<p>

Your performance in this class will be evaluated through homework
assignments, in class quizzes, programming assignments, and two midterm exams.
The weights of each of these components is as follows:

<ul>
<li>Midterm Exam: 20%
<li>Homework and quizzes: 10% (If applicable, otherwise this 10% added to Programming Assignments)
<li>Programming Assignments: 70%
</ul>

Exams are open book and open notes.  You may bring a non-programmable
calculator and printed notes from the class, no other electronic
devices may be used, in particular no Internet access is allowed.  The
exams will take place during class as scheduled.

<p>

There are no makeup exams unless arranged explicitly in advance with
the instructor.  This will only be possible for valid non-academic reasons.

<p>

Homework assignments will be due at the beginning of lecture on the
due date.  Programming assignments will be submitted electronically by
11:59 on the due date and will require you to use your departmental
Linux account.  Turnin time will be the time recorded by the turnin
program you will use to turn in the assignments.  You may not email
your assignments to the teaching staff.

<p>

Project submissions will each include a code listing and a written
project description, which will include a description of the software
architecture of the system and a user's guide.  Grading also generally
involves interactive demonstrations of the programs by the students if
needed as determined by the TA.  Programs will be graded on
correctness, readability, style, and documentation.  Program
development may be done anywhere, but the version of the assignments
that is turned in and demonstrated must be able to be built and
executed on the publix Linux machines on which software for this
course is supported.

<p>

You have a "late account" of 3 days for the term which you can spend
any way you choose for your programming assigments.  For example, you
can turn in three programs one day late each, or one program 3 days
late, without penalty. Once you have exhausted your late account, no
late assignments will be accepted.

<p>

<B>Academic Misconduct Policy</B>

<p>

You are free to discuss the course material with your classmates and
are encouraged to form study groups for the exams.  However,
collaboration on homework or programming assignments is <b>not</b>
permitted unless explicitly stated by the instructor.  Helping a
friend understand the intent of a homework or programming assignment
specification is permitted. Students who work together too closely
(e.g.  design their solution together) should be aware that this is a
form of cheating called COLLUSION and is subject to academic
penalties.  Penalties for academic misconduct include but are not
limited to a failing grade in this course.

<p>

The homework, programs, and exams must be the work of students turning
them in. You are responsible for familiarity with the University
policy (see Dean of Students' <a
href="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php">
policies on academic integrity</a>) on academic integrity, which we
will follow strictly.

<p>

Acts that exceed the bounds defined by the approved collaboration
practices will be considered cheating. Such acts include:

<ul>

<li>Copying solutions, code, or programs from someone else or giving
someone else your solutions, code, or programs

<li>Participation in a discussion group that develops a solution that
everyone copies

</ul>

We urge everyone in the class to take appropriate measures for
protecting one's work. You should protect your files, homework
solution sheets, etc. as deemed reasonable.

<p>

Studying for tests together is permitted and encouraged. Please come
talk to us if you are unsure about how to work together with your
friend in a legal, helpful manner.  Remember, it is always ok to "work
together" with your professor or TA!

<p>

<b>Your Responsibilities in This Class</b><p>

<ul>

<li>You are expected to show up on time for lectures.

<li>You are responsible for all material posted to the web site and
announcements via Piazza.  Ignorance of such material is no excuse.

<li>You are responsible for obtaining a departmental Linux account, and
learning the Linux operating system sufficiently well to meet the
demands of the course.  You can find on-line Linux guides - a place to
start is
<a href="http://www.linux.org/categories/linux-tutorials.52/">
here</a>. 

<li>You are responsible for all material presented in lecture and in
the reading assignments.

<li>Your performance in this class will be determined by you!  It will
require a strong dedication to learning the material and may require a
substantial time commitment to complete the programming assignments.

<li>You are responsible for turning in your own work on all
assignments.  Unauthorized collusion is not allowed and constitutes a
violation of the university's policies on academic integrity.  See
above guidelines for more information on what is or is not allowed.

<li>You are responsible for protecting your work from being copied
by others.

</ul>

<p>

<b>Programming Infrastructure</b><p>

The programming assignments will require use of the Department of
Computer Sciences instructional computing resources.  All CS students
who meet the prerequisites for CS354 are eligible for a CS
departmental lab account.  We will be doing projects using OpenGL and
C++.  User interfaces will be developed using GLUT or
<a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a> to make user interface building
easier and to make the inferfaces portable across platforms.

<p>

Software needed for your projects is installed on the public Linux
machines in the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/public-labs"> GDC labs</a>.
If you have trouble running the software, please report it to either
the instructor or the TA.  You can feel free to download and install
the support software we are using on your own machines and work there,
but you will need to turn in programs that work on the public Linux
machines.  Instructions for using software for each programming
project on the lab machines will be given out with the assignments.

<p>

You will turn in assignments using Canvas according to the guidelines
provided by the TA.
