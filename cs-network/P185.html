    yourself. You cannot work with anyone else in the class or with someone 
    outside of the class. The code your write must be your own. You are

Description: </b>The purposes of this assignment are:<ol>
      <li>To create a program to produce required output.</li>
      <li>To practice creating structured programs</li>
      <li>To practice removing redundancy from programs.</li>
	  <li>To learn the procedures and tools for writing an submitting programs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Complete the items on the class <a href="../handouts/startup.htm">
    start up page</a>. If you get stuck post to the class discussion group on 
    Piazza or go see the instructor or a TA in the lab.</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new project and add the
      <a href="../javaCode/A1_Song/Song.java">Song.java</a> file.
      <a href="../../cs307/handouts/BlueJProjectInstructions.html">This page has 
      instructions on how to create projects and add source code to BlueJ</a>.
  </li>
  <li> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">BlueJ truncates the output in the console to approximately 
      20 lines. This results in your output being cutoff in some cases.<br>

      To prevent this, go to the <b>Options </b>menu on the
      <b>Terminal Window </b>that pops up when you run your program, ensure 
      ensure the menu options <b>Clear screen at method call</b> and <b>
      Unlimited buffering </b>are checked. After making these changes you may 
      have to stop and restart BlueJ for the choice to take effect. </li>

    Here is the output file the graders will use on assignment 1.<a href="../javaCode/A1_Song/A1_Song_Output.txt">(A1_Song_Output.txt</a>) 
    Your output must match this exactly or you may lose points for correctness. 
    Use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_comparison">diff tool</a> 
    such as the one at this website ( <a href="http://www.quickdiff.com">
    www.quickdiff.com</a>) to ensure your program produces the correct output. 
    Please note, if you view the output above via a web browser, the browser 
    will very likely remove the last newline character. This causes a minor 
    difference between the expected output and your output.

    The last line of the song, &quot;She died 
    of course.&quot;, is printed out with a println statement, just like all the 
    other lines of the song. I recommend you download the <a href="../javaCode/A1_Song/A1_Song_Output.txt">
	A1_Song_Output.txt</a> file by putting your cursor over the link and 
	bringing up a context menu (right click on Windows, control click on Macs)

    </span>In particular, you are to make sure that you use only one

    <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: 12pt;">
    <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In other words this is bad:</span></p>

    <b>There is, however, a structural redundancy that you can eliminate with 
    static methods.</b><span style><b>&nbsp;</b> </span>The key question to ask yourself is 
    whether or not you have repeated lines of code or statements that could be 
    eliminated if you structured your static methods differently. These lines of 
    codes could be calls to static methods instead of println statements.</span></p>
