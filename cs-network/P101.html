<H2>CS361C Assignment (Declare Project Topic)  </H2>

<P><B>Due:</B> March 2, 2015.

<H3>The Assignment</H3>

Hopefully, by now you have been in contact with your group members and
collectively deciding on a project topic. It's time to get started on
the project in earnest. By March 2, you should do the following:
<ol> 
<li> Reserve your project topic with Dr. Young via email.  There will
  be a list of topics that are already taken on the website.  Your
  topic must be substantively different from that of any other
  group.  So select sooner rather than later.<BR><BR>
<li> Create and submit a document containing the following:<Br><BR>

<ol>
  <li> a short but informative description (a few paragraphs) describing your
    project topic and why it is relevant to this class; and <BR><BR>
  <li> at least six resourses you have found (on-line or otherwise)
    that you will use as sources for your project research.  List them
    with descriptions in the form of an annotated bibliography. If the
    resources are on-line resources, be sure that you include
    a URL.  Use good citation style.<BR>
</ol>
