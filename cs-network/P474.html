1. We are given a set X of k-bit words and we are told that X was obtained from
   a dependent set Y of k-bit words by removing only one k-bit word w from Y. 
   Even though we are only given set X (and not set Y), compute the removed
   word w.

2. We are given a set X of k-bit words and we are told that X was obtained from
   a dependent set Y of k-bit words by adding only one k-bit word w to Y. 
   Even though we are only given set X (and not set Y), compute the added
   word w.

Solution:

The solutions for both problems are the same, namely the required w is computed 
as the exclusive-or of the k-bit words in the given set X.
