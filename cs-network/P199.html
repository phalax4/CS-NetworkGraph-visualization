------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider the algorithm to compute gcd(x,y), a, and b, such that the following 
three conditions hold:

		1. x and y are given positive integers
		2. a and b are computed integers
		3. gcd(x,y) = a*x + b*y

This algorithm has six local variables u, v, a, b, at, and bt, and has one 
loop of the form 

		while v != 0 do .. od 

If the given x and y are 29 and 17, respectively, how many iterations of this 
loop are executed by this algorithm? List the values of u and v at the 
beginning of each iteration.

Solution:

5 iterations are executed. The values of u and v at the beginning of each
iteration are:

u = 29, v = 17
u = 17, v = 12
u = 12, v = 5
u = 5,  v = 2
u = 2,  v = 1
u = 1,  v = 0 (not executed)
