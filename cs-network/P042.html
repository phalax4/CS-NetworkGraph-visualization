<!-- Suggestions for the next time I teach this: 
0. Have the students use LaTeX for paper submission.
1. For the paper, use a standard 2 column format (perhaps the one from
CISSE). 
2. Use the exercise from my 2014 CISSE paper on using faculty research
in teaching. 
3. Get a better handle on students coming in late or staying on their
devices all during class. 
4. Update the slides;  add some pictures.

<H3>Course Description:</H3> Information Assurance is dedicated to
keeping information safe from harm.  This encompasses computer
security, but also communications security, operations security, and
physical security. That's a lot to study in one course.  For example,
NSA has an Information Assurance Directorate tasked with: 
"detecting, reporting, and responding to cyber threats; making
encryption codes to securely pass information between systems; and
embedding IA measures directly into the emerging Global Information
Grid. It includes building secure audio and video communications
equipment, making tamper protection products, and providing trusted
microelectronics solutions. It entails testing the security of
customers' systems, providing OPSEC assistance, and evaluating
commercial software and hardware against nationally set standards, to
better meet our nation's IA needs."<P>

Our approach will be to cover selected topics from this very broad
area of study with the goal of preparing the student to think
critically about security from a wholistic perspective, rather than a
purely technical perspective.  Also, the topics covered will be those
deemed necessary for the InfoSec Certification.  Topics may include:
<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
<LI>Introduction to Information Assurance
<LI>Metrics for Information Assurance
<LI>Networking and Cryptography
<LI>Information Assurance Planning and Deployment
<LI>Vulnerabilities and Protection
<LI>Identity and Trust Technologies
<LI>Verification and Evaluation
<LI>Incident Response
<LI>Human Factors
<LI>Legal, Ethical, and Social Implications 
</OL>

<I>Students are expected to read assigned materials prior to the class
meeting and to participate actively in the discussion.</i> A
significant portion of your grade will be based on your engagement in
the class.<P>

Notice that CS students at UT have the option of completing a number
of security-related courses and receiving a government-sanctioned certification in
security.  See the following link for information: 
<A HREF="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/curriculum/infosec-certificate">Infosec Certification</A>.

<P>

<H3>Prerequisites:</H3> You are expected to have taken and passed the
following courses (or equivalent) with a grade of at least C-:
Computer Science 311, 311H, 313H, or 313K; Computer Science 307, 314,
314H, 315, or 315H; Computer Science 310, 310H, 429, or 429H; and
Mathematics 408C, 408K, or 408N.  If you don't have the prerequisites,
be sure to clear it with the CS department, or risk being dropped from
the course.<P>

<H3>Using Piazza:</H3> We will be using Piazza for class
discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and
efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing
questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your
questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the
developers, email team@piazza.com.  Our class page will be set up
shortly and announced here.

<H3>Textbook and Slides:</H3> 

There is no required text for the class this semester.<P>

Handouts of all class slides will be made available over the course of
the semester via links below.  Slides din PDF format.  The PDF files
can be viewed with Acroread.  If you print from Acroread, you can
print 2 or 4 slides per page;  I suggest that you do so to save paper.<P>

<H3>Readings and Assignments:</H3> I will occasionally assign readings
from papers over the course of the semester.  You are expected to have
read the assigned material and also to have read the course slides
before class.  There may be pop quizzes on this material at any
time.<P>

There will be several projects assigned over the course of the
semester.  Each student should work on assignments individually unless
I explicitly say that teams are allowed.  The projects generally will
not be programming projects, but will involve writing short reports on
various aspects of security.  This is not a writing course and your
spelling and grammar skill will not be graded.  Rather, the grade will
depend on the amount of thought and (possibly) research you put into
the assignment. However, you should strive to produce quality work
that is grammatically correct and formatted nicely.<P>


<!-- It is likely that several of the assignments will be related to a
given topic.  This semester, that topic will
be <i>CyberWarfare</i>.<P> -->

<b>Standing assignment:</b> Read over the class slides before we
discuss them.<P>

<b>Semester project:</B> In addition to the other assignments, teams
of 5 students will become experts in some specialized security topic,
write a paper on that topic, and make a presentation to the class. A
partial list of possible topics will be offered.  If a topic strikes
your fancy, you can claim it by sending me an email.  All topics must
be distinct.  Since there over 100 students in the class, it is infeasible
for students to work alone on this.  However, the fact that you are
working as teams of 5 means that your product must be a high quality
team effort.<P>

An alternative to a class presentation is to produce a high quality
video describing your work.  It will be shown in class in lieu of your
presentation.  An excellent example from a previous semester is here:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAWk-RmN93w&feature=youtu.be">Drone
  Video</A><P>

You will be provided very specific formatting instructions for the
project paper.  In particular, it will be done using LaTeX and
following a format provided.  This has two goals:
<ol>
<li> it eliminates the tendency to fudge the length of the paper by
  padding;
<li> it teaches you a very useful technical skill if you ever plan to
  publish in a technical arena (or even if you don't).
</ol>
Everything you need to know about LaTeX will be provided.<P>

<a id='tests'></a>
<H3>Quizzes:</H3> Short in-class quizzes may be given at any time.
These will cover material covered in previous classes and check
whether you are keeping up with the reading. <I>There
will be no makeups for quizzes you miss,</I> but any single quiz is
only a tiny proportion of your final grade.<P>

<a href='#top'>Return to top of page.</a><br />

<H3>Tests:</H3> There will be two major tests during the semester.
Both tests will be given during the regular class-time. The first will
be March 11; the second will be May 6.  Here's a midterm exam from a
previous semester:
<A HREF="sample-midterm2.pdf">Sample midterm</A>.
Your best study strategy is to review the readings and class notes and
ensure that you understand thoroughly the topics we covered in class.
Tests are open book / open notes. <P>

<!-- The <b>midterm</b> will be held March 6, in class
and will cover those topics we have covered in class up to that
point. A sample midterm will be posted. -->

<!-- here: <A HREF="sample-midterm2.pdf">sample midterm</A>.  Don't worry
about the specific questions on the sample, but understand that the
form will be very similar.   -->

The <B>final test</B> will be held in class the last week of
classes. A sample final test will be posted.  There will be no final
exam during the exam period.<P>

<H3>No laptops:</H3> Students are asked not to have their laptops or
other electronic devices open during class.  Copies of all slides will
be provided.  Please just listen, participate, and absorb the material. <P>

<H3>Grading policies:</H3> Class attendance is required and will be
checked on a majority of class days.  Excessive unexcused absences
will result in a reduced grade.  <I>If you don't plan to come to class
regularly, don't register for this class.</I> Signing in for another
student not present will be considered cheating by both students.<P>

Grades are averaged using the weighting below, with the following
proviso: <I>You will not receive passing credit for the course if you
have unexcused absences for more than half of the scheduled class
meetings at which attendance is taken.</I><P>

Also, this class largely consists of discussion.  You <i>must</i>
participate in the discussions.  If you are either too shy or too lazy
to participate, it will affect your grade negatively.  Please discuss
it with me if you have issues that keep you from speaking up in
class. <BR /><BR />

Course grades are assigned on the scale: A = 90-100; B = 80-90; etc.,
except that I reserve the right to be more generous than this
indicates.  That is, I may enlarge any of these ranges;  I will not
shrink any range.<P>

<H3>How to Succeed in this Class:</H3> 

You succeed in this class by participating fully.  It may be possible
to coast through it, but you won't get a good grade.  

<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
<LI>Come to class regularly
<LI>Read the slides before class
<LI>Think carefully about the questions embedded in the slides
(usually in purple)
<LI>Do any assigned readings on time
<LI>Participate in the class discussions
<LI>Take enough time and care with the assignments
</OL>

<H3>Scholastic Dishonesty:</H3> Academic dishonesty will not be
tolerated.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct</A>
<!-- <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html">www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html</A> -->
for an excellent summary of expectations of a student in a CS
class.<P>

All work must be the student's own effort (with the exception of
explicitly approved group effort on projects).  No deviation from the
standards of scholastic honesty or professional integrity will be
tolerated.  Scholastic dishonesty is a serious violation of UT policy;
and will likely result in an automatic F in the course and may result
in further penalties imposed by the department or by the university.
Don't do it.  If you are caught, you will regret it.  And if you're
not caught, you're still a cheater.<P>
