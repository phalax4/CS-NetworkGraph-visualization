<h2><b>Discussion Section Problem Set 2<br></b></h2>
<h3><b> Due in Section on Friday, September 15, 2017 </h3></b>
</center>
The problem set must be completed before section and brought to section.  To
ensure that your problem set is turned in correctly and that you receive credit
for discussion section, you must follow these guidelines exactly.

<ul>
<li>Include the following header at the top of your file:
<pre>
Discussion Section Problem Set #: 
Student Name:
EID:
CS login:
Email address:
Unique Number: 
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>You may either type your answers or write them by hand, but you must bring a
  hard copy to discussion section.
  </li>
<p>
<li>
   In discussion section, your TA will check that you make a good effort on the
problem set and that you are participating in the discussions in section and
ready and able to answer when called upon.  If all of those are true, you will
receive credit for discussion section that day.  Note that a "good effort" on
the problem set includes that all answers are in your own words and <i>not</i>
copied from anywhere else, including the slide deck.
</li>
</ul>

<!--Number One--->
<li>
Name and briefly describe three OS interfaces.
<p> 
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Two--->
<li>
 Given the following piece of code:
<pre>
   main(int argc, char** argv)
   {
      forkThem(5);
   }

   void forkThem(int n)
   {
      if(n>0)
      {
         fork();
         forkThem(n-1);
      }
   }
</pre>
<p>
How many processes are created if the above piece of code is run?<br>
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Three--->
<li>
How can fairness and throughput be competing goals for a scheduler?
Give an example where a fair scheduler makes bad use of the CPU and an
example where a high-throughput scheduler is unfair.
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!--Number Four--->
<li>
Most round-robin schedulers use a fixed size quantum.  Give an
argument in favor of and against a small quantum.
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Five--->
<li>
Open a terminal on a departmental Linux machine.  After ensuring that you are in
a bash shell, use the <tt>time</tt> command to measure the time taken by a Linux
command that sends output to the screen (and maybe other things as well).  You
may use any Linux command you like.  For instance, a sample run might be (from
your Project 0 directory):

<p>
<tt>
time make
</tt>
<p>
Inspect the output.  Explain the meaning of each line.  Is the output as you
would expect?  Why or why not?  Include your command in your answer.
