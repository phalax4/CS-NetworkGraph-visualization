<H2>How to Make an A</H2>
<HR>

<P>
<H4>Always Go to Class.</H4>
As Woody Allen said, <I>80% of success is showing up.</I>
If you are in the hospital and in a coma, that is an excuse to miss class.
If you are in the hospital but not in a coma, pull the IV's out of your arm,
get out of bed, and go to class.

<P>
<H4>Take Notes.</H4>
Taking notes (on the printed course packet) forces information to go
through your brain, increasing the chance that you will remember it.

<P>
<H4>Start Assignments Early.</H4>
A retrospective study of one class found that every student who started
their project early made an A.  Every student who started late made
less than an A.
