<h1 class="style2">Video Instructions on Using NetBeans</h1>
<p class="style1">The following videos can be viewed on Windows Platforms using 
Windows Media Player (or something equivalent).&nbsp; You may need to install 
the <a href="tscc.exe">TechSmith codex</a> for viewing these videos.</p>
<h2 class="style3">Project Creation</h2>
<p class="style1">Every program that you create will be stored in a project.&nbsp; 
The following <a href="NetBeansVideos/CreateProjectNB.avi">video</a> shows how to create a
<strong>HelloWorld</strong> project and program.</p>
<h2 class="style3">Project Compile and Run</h2>
<p class="style1">Once you've created the source of your project, you're ready 
to compile it and run it, requiring only 2 button clicks as this
<a href="NetBeansVideos/CompileAndRunNB.avi">video</a> shows.</p>
<h2 class="style3">Unit Test Creation</h2>
<p class="style1">On some programs, you want to create a unit test.&nbsp; As our 
HelloWorld program consists only of a single Java program that prints to stdout, 
the first step is to create a unit test for the Main.java file.&nbsp; Next is to 
follow the instructions list on this page to capture stdout and to compare 
correct output to file output.&nbsp; In this case, we know that our program runs 
correctly, so the output file is renamed to be &quot;correct.txt&quot;.&nbsp; All 
subsequent unit tests of HelloWorld will have its output compared to 
&quot;correct.txt&quot;.&nbsp; Watch this
<a href="NetBeansVideos/CreateTestNB.avi">video</a> to see 
these actions live.</p>
<h2 class="style3">Unit Test Runs</h2>
<p class="style1">Lastly, we know that our program runs correctly, so we run the 
unit test and it fails the first time.&nbsp; The reason is that there is no &quot;<strong>correct.txt</strong>&quot; 
file that contains the output for a correct execution.&nbsp; However, we know 
the output file &quot;<strong>out.txt</strong>&quot; can be renamed to be &quot;<strong>correct.txt</strong>&quot;.&nbsp; 
All subsequent unit tests of HelloWorld will have its output compared to 
&quot;correct.txt&quot;.&nbsp; Watch this <a href="NetBeansVideos/runtestNB.avi">video</a> to see 
these actions live.</p>
