Consider the protocol for maintaining local topology information in Section
11.2. Assume that in this protocol an element up[g] in process p[i] has a 
wrong value true when at least one of the two channels between p[i] and p[g]
is down. What is the maximum number of messages that p[i] can receive from
p[g] before it assigns its element up[g] the correct value false? What is the 
minimum number of messages that p[i] can receive from p[g] before it assigns  
its element up[g] the correct vale false?

Solution:

The maximum number of messages is 2:

* start from a state where channel from p[i] to p[g] is down and
channel from p[g] to p[i] is up and has a chk(1) message.

The minimum number of messages is 0:

* start from a state where both channels between p[i] and p[g] are
  down.
