<title>CS343 Artificial Intelligence: Homework</title>

<h1>CS343 Homework Assignments</h1>

There will be six homework assignments, approximately one every two
weeks.  The assigments consist of putting AI techniques into practice
in a simulated 3D virtual world
called <a href="http://opennero.github.io">OpenNERO</a>. OpenNERO
consists of several challenge environments for intelligent
agents. Simple AI already exists for all these environments, written
in Python; the task is to implement a more robust, sophisticated, or
powerful versions, and test them in the environment. <p>

The homework assignments are done in groups of two; the idea is NOT to
split up the work, but to <a
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgramming">work together</a> so
that both of you will learn more. You will turn in one joint report
clearly identifying the students who should get credit for it.  (In
exceptional cases, you may also work alone, but you must justify your
case to Risto or the TA ahead of time.)
<p>
<!--
If you have questions about the assignments, you should go to the TA's
office hours or send him email. You will also turn in your work to the
TA.  Each assignment is due by midnight of the due date, and must be
turned in electronically using the Canvas system; What you need to turn in is
specified in each assignment separately. Ascii, html, postscript, and
pdf are all acceptable formats; Microsoft files (Word, Powerpoint,
Excel, rtf, etc) or any other evil proprietary file formats ARE NOT
ACCEPTED. If you do not have a unix account in the CS department, you
can get one <a
href="https://udb.cs.utexas.edu/udb/amut/acut/">here</a>; setting up
the account may take several days so don't wait until the first
assignment to request it! If you are unfamiliar with Unix, consider
participating in a CS dept unix seminar (they are usually offered
during the first couple of weeks of the semester). <p>
