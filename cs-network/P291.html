<p>
Homework will generally be assigned every week on Monday, and it is
due nine days later on Wednesday at the beginning of class.  Of
course, you may bring finished homework to class; otherwise, you must
place homework assignments in the CS Homework drop box.  Remember,
late homework is not accepted, but the two lowest homework grades will
be dropped.  Assignments will appear here as the semester progresses.
Please show your work -- partial credit cannot be awarded if just an
incorrect answer is given.  Each homework must have a homework cover
sheet (<a href="homework/cs429-hunt-hw-cover-sheet.pdf">for Hunt's
Section</a>) (<a href="homework/cs429-young-hw-cover-sheet.pdf">for
Young's section</a>) attached to the front.  Only write the
information requested on this cover sheet; do not include your UT ID
number nor your Taxpayer ID number.

<p>
You may discuss the homework questions with your peers, but the end
product that you turn in should be your own work.  We want you to
learn with and from your peers, but each of you is responsibile for
your own work.

<h2>
Extra Credit:
</center>
</h2>

<p>
Many students have asked for an option to do some "extra credit".
Assigning "extra credit" in a curved class is a tricky affair, because
if enough students participate, it can affect the curve.  We
contemplated making the Laboratory 3(b) extra credit, but we decided
it would be difficult to access in a fair way.  Additionally, we feel
that the second half of Homework #7 deserves more weight than just one
homework grade.  As such, we are offering all students the following
option.

<p>
If a student turns in a perfectly working solution for the second
question in Homework #7 by noon on April 24, 2014, (there are no late
acceptances and there is no partial credit), their Homework #7 grade
will be replaced with a 100, and they will earn a third dropped
homework grade.  To turnin the perfectly working 64-bit factorial
program, type:

<p>
<h4>turnin --submit ragerdl extra-credit fact.y86</h4>

<p>
Students may find the following C <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ragerdl/cs352-2006/homework7/64bit-mult.c">template</a>
useful for completing this problem:




<p>
The code included in fact.y86 should include a main routine (like in
Laboratory 3(a) and HW #6) that calls the function fact.  All other
function names are left up to the student.

<p>
Students who made a 100 on the original homework 7 assignment will be
credited with having completed this extra credit opportunity and are
not required to turn in anything.

<h4>
   Correction to Laboratory 0: For the problem "is_ascii" and
   "is_character" the use of the "<" operator is OK, even though it
   is disallowed by the coding instructions in the "problems.c" file.

   Clarification for Laboratory 0: For the problems "times_7",
   "is_ascii", "is_character", and "remainder_by_8", the range is now
   specified by an equation.

   Correction for Laboratory 0: For the problem "times_7", you may use
   up to four (4) operations.

   Correction for Laboratory 0: For the problem "is_character" you may
   use up to six (6) operations.

<h4>Laboratory 2:</h4>

The files for the laboratory can be found directly in the UTCS
filesystem.  The assembler and simulator have been combined into a
single program that you may execute by entering


<h5>/projects/hvg/CS429-Y86/y86</h5>

at a command prompt.  There is no need to download this file, as it is
quite large, and attempting to put a copy in your directory may cause
you a disk quota problem.  There is file with the examples we have
discussed:

<h5>/projects/hvg/CS429-Y86/y86-code.lsp</h5>

This file may be downloaded and used as you wish.  Finally, we have
the specification for the Y86 machine written in the ACL2 logic.  It
can be downloaded and inspected.

<h5>/projects/hvg/CS429-Y86/y86.lisp</h5>

<p>
A copy of the file
<a href="labs/y86-coding/examples.c">examples.c</a>
is available.

<p>
The instructions for Lab 2 may be downloaded directly
(<a href="labs/y86-coding/y86-coding.pdf">PDF</a>).  Given:  Wednesday,
October 8, 2014, Part A Due: Wednesday, November 5, 2014, by 9:00 am,
Part B Due: Wednesday, November 19, 2014, by 9:00 am.


<p><li> <h4>Laboratory 3:</h4>

This lab is running the "memory mountain" <a
href="labs/memory-mountain/memory-mountain.tar">
labs/memory-mountain/memory-mountain.tar</a> code (pages 621 -- 625)
from the class textbook on a X86-compatible computer.  The <a
