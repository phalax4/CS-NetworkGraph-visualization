<h2><b>Discussion Section Problem Set 9<br></b></h2>
<h3><b> Due in Section on Friday, November 17, 2017 </h3></b>
</center>
The problem set must be completed before section and brought to section.  To
ensure that your problem set is turned in correctly and that you receive credit
for discussion section, you must follow these guidelines exactly.

<ul>
<li>Include the following header at the top of your file:
<pre>
Discussion Section Problem Set #: 
Student Name:
EID:
CS login:
Email address:
Unique Number: 
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>You may either type your answers or write them by hand, but you must bring a
  hard copy to discussion section.
  </li>
<p>
<li>
   In discussion section, your TA will check that you make a good effort on the
problem set and that you are participating in the discussions in section and
ready and able to answer when called upon.  If all of those are true, you will
receive credit for discussion section that day.  Note that a "good effort" on
the problem set includes that all answers are in your own words and <i>not</i>
copied from anywhere else, including the slide deck.
</li>
</ul>
