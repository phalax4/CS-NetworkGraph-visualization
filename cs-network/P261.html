<H2>Gnu Common Lisp for Microsoft Windows</H2>
<HR>
(If what you want is an interface to X Windows for GCL, that is
<a href="dwindow.html">here.</a>)
<HR>

For a complete installation of 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl/gcl.html">Gnu Common Lisp</a>
get <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/gcl/gcl-2.6.1.exe">
gcl-2.6.1.exe</a> (15 MB download, 60 MB to install).  Unfortunately,
at present this version of GCL produces a ^M (Return) character at the
end of each line when used within Emacs.
<P>
For convenience, a version of GCL
for Windows, renamed <TT>gcl.exe</TT>, is available for download
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/gcl/gcl.exe">here</a> (3.4 MB).
To install this software, put <TT>gcl.exe</TT> directly into <TT>C:/</TT>.
This is an older version, but is smaller and does not produce
the ^M characters.
<P>
GCL can be executed directly by double-clicking on it, but it
is better when run from within
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html">Emacs.</a>

<P>
<H3>Connecting Emacs to GCL:</H3>

The following steps will connect Emacs to GCL so that GCL can be run using
the Emacs command <TT>M-x run-lisp</TT>.
<OL>
<LI> If you do the full installation, GCL will be installed in Program Files.
     Otherwise, put <TT>gcl.exe</TT> directly into <TT>C:/</TT>.  
<LI> Define the <TT>HOME</TT> environment variable: <BR>
     Start -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables <BR>
     Then define a new System variable <TT>HOME</TT> as your "home"
     directory, e.g.
<PRE>
C:/Documents and Settings/myname/My Documents/
</PRE>
where <TT>myname</TT> would be replaced by your user name.
<LI> Put the following file into your <TT>HOME</TT> directory:
     <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/gcl/mingw/.emacs">
     <TT>.emacs</TT></a> if using the full installation,
     <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/gcl/.emacs"><TT>.emacs</TT></a>
     if using <TT>gcl.exe</TT>.
     Note: when doing a <TT>Save As</TT>, be sure to save the file as
     text (<TT>.txt</TT>).  The file must be named <TT>.emacs</TT>;
     right-click on the link above, then use Save Target As and change
     the name of the saved file to <TT>".emacs"</TT>, adding the quotation
     marks so that Windows will accept the file name.
     Alternatively, you can get the file by FTP.
<LI> If using the full installation, put the file
     <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/gcl/mingw/gcl1.bat">gcl1.bat</a>
     into the directory <BR>
     <TT>C:\Program Files\GCL-2.6.1\bin</TT>

<LI> For convenience, put the following file into <TT>C:/</TT>
     <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/gcl/loadf.lsp">
        <TT>loadf.lsp</TT></a>
     Edit the file path in <TT>loadf.lsp</TT> to be the base directory
     you would like (such as your <TT>HOME</TT> directory).
</OL>
<P>
To use Lisp from within Emacs:
<OL>
<LI> Start Emacs.  It is convenient to split Emacs into two sub-windows
     using <TT>C-x 2</TT> or <TT>C-x 3</TT> ; then you can run Lisp in
     one half-window while editing code in the other half-window.
<LI> Start Lisp in one sub-window with <TT>M-x run-lisp</TT> &nbsp
     (For <TT>M-x</TT>, hold down the <TT>Alt</TT> key while typing <TT>x</TT>.)
<LI> Enter <TT>(load "C:/loadf.lsp")</TT>
<LI> Now you can load files using <TT>(loadf "myfile.lsp")</TT>
     or <TT>(loadf "mydir/myfile.lsp")</TT>
     where the file path that is specified to <TT>loadf</TT> will
     be the path from the base directory that was edited in <TT>loadf.lsp</TT>
</OL>
<P>
Thanks to Jan Kok for suggestions for improving these instructions.
