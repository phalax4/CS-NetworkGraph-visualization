This course is devoted to computer system organizations and
architectures.  The course involves the study of computer architecture
by the study of a simplified X86-like computer architecture.  We will
make great use of the material in "Computer Systems, A Programmer's
Perspective", as well as some material specifically developed for this
course.

<p>
In addition to being a UTCS undergraduate student, the prerequisites
we expect for this class include the successful completion of the CS312
(Introduction to Programming), CS313K or CS311, and CS314 (Data
Structures) courses.

<p>
In general, the information found
in <a href="./CodeOfConduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> is a good guide
on how to conduct yourself in this class.  Additional general
information about College of Natural Sciences (CNS) class coursework
and procedures can be found in Vice Provost Laude's
<a href="./CNS_Coursework_Routine_09-10.pdf">memorandum</a> to the
CNS faculty.

<p>
This course should comply with the requirements of the University and
the State of Texas.  Texas <a href="./hb2504.txt">House Bill 2504 </a>

<p>
Any scholastic dishonesty will be referred to the Dean of Students
Office.  The following passage is taken from the University of Texas
at Austin Information Handbook for Faculty.

<p>
<ul>
The Discipline Policies Committee believes that in most cases of
scholastic dishonesty the student forfeits the right to credit in that
course, and that a penalty of "F" for the course may be warranted.
In addition to the academic penalties assigned by a faculty member,
the Dean of Students or the hearing officer may assign one or more of
the University discipline penalties listed in the "General
Information" bulletin, Appendix C, Sections 11-501 and 11-502.
Certain types of misconduct, such as a student substituting for
someone else on an exam or having someone substitute for the student,
submitting a purchased term paper, or altering academic records, have
usually involved a penalty of suspension from the University.
</ul>

<p>
As a reminder, the "UT Code of Conduct" is included below, and
additional <a href="http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/the-university/#universitycodeofconduct">information</a>
on-line where one may find additional information (through additional
links) about what constitutes plagiarism, cheating, etc.
Specifically,
the <a href="http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/academic-policies-and-procedures/">Academic
Policies and Procedures of UT Austin</a> may be consulted if you have
any questions.

<ul>
The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning,
discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and
responsibility.  Each member of the University is expected to uphold
these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
toward peers and community.
</ul>

<p>
We fully support the University's scholastic honesty policies, and we
will follow the University's policies in the event of any scholastic
dishonesty.  If you are ever unsure whether some act would be
considered in violation of the University's policies, do not hesitate
to ask your instructors or other University academic representatives.

A notice regarding accommodations for religious holidays.  By UT

<p>
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the
Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, or see the
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/safety/">safety office website</a>.

<p>
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are
required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated.  Alarm
activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and
building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not
be the one you used when entering the building.  Students requiring
assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing
during the first week of class.  In the event of an evacuation, follow
the instruction of faculty or class instructors.  Do not re-enter a
building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or
Fire Prevention Services office.

<p>
A <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/emergency">link</a> to information
regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures is
available.
