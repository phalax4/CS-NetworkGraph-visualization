<p>
In this class, we will discuss how computers are organized and how
primitive building blocks can be used to create a computing system.
We will inspect a subset of the X86 instruction-set architecture and
we will investigate how to program at the assembler level.  We will
introduce students to modern microprocessor memory hierarchy and other
aspects of contemporary computing systems.  Student participation and
interest can partially influence the topics discussed and the
assignments given, so feel free to suggest items of interest to you.
The point of this course is to build up awareness of computer
organization so the interested student is ready to pursue more
advanced computer-architecture topics and to be a better user and
programmer of computers.

<p>
The text book for this class is "Computer Systems, A Programmer's
Perspective" by Randal E. Bryant and David O'Hallaron, Prentice Hall,
2011.  In the book preface (page xxiii), there are five different
kinds of courses that the authors propose.  In our class, we will
follow the Course ORG+ most closely.  Tests and quizzes are open-book,
open-notes affairs -- however, no electronic devices (laptops, cell
phones, tablets, PDAs, calculators) of any kind are allowed during
testing and quizzes.  As such, you may very-much wish to have a
physical copy of the book as it will be a helpful reference during
testing periods.  The class that follows this class, CS439, also uses
the same textbook -- so for the price of one book, you can use it in
two classes.

<p>
We will program some in C.  We recommend you have access to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_(book)">
"The C Programming Language"</a>, second edition, by Brian Kernighan
and Dennis Ritchie, Prentice Hall Software Series.  For examples and
help with C-language use, you will find that there are many, many Web
pages devoted to C-language programming.  Why C, or its extension,
C++?  It is the language that is used to implement many systems, such
as FreeBSD, Linux, MacOS, Windows, as well as many user tools (e.g.,
grep, ed, sed, emacs,...).  Java programmers should have no problem
with the subset of C that we will use; for the subset used, its
behavior will be similar Java language statements.

<p>
Our office hours are listed on the main class webpage.  In addition,
if you need help, you may certainly seek out and visit with the class
TAs.  You may arrange to meet us at other times than those listed, but
you will need to send E-mail to arrange a time.

<p>
The following gives an outline of what we will discuss.  We are open
to discussing other architecture topics of general interest, and we
will include some of our own microprocessor design experience.  The
syllabus below is approximate; the exact rate at which we will cover
some material may vary.

<p>
There will be three in-class examinations, two short (50 to 60 minute)
exams and one midterm (70 to 80 minute) exam.  See the class syllabus
(marked with a "*" above) for the dates.  There will be a number of
"pop quizzes".  There will be a final (150 minute) exam given.
Homework will be assigned each week on Monday and due nine days later
(Wednesday) by class time; no homework will be assigned the last week
of class, and there may be an easy project due the last week of
classes.<P>

To the best of our current knowledge, the <b>final exams</b> are: 
<ul>
<li> Young's class:  Friday, December 12, 9am-noon, JES A121A
<li> Hunt's class:   Monday, December 15, 2-5pm, FAC 21 
</ul>
You should probably confirm this for yourself at the UT Registrar's website.<P>

The weighting of the grades for the various aspects of the course are:
in-class exams - 32% (Midterm 12%, short exams each 10%), quizzes 5%,
final exam - 20%, homework - 15%, and class projects - 28%.  The two
lowest homework grades will be dropped in the computation of the final
homework grade; homework is not be accepted late.  The lowest quiz
grade will be dropped, and pop quizzes must be taken when given.
Projects may be turned in one week late, but no later than the last
day of class; late project submissions suffer a 20% reduction of the
grade given for the content of the project.  Examinations and quizzes
must be taken at the scheduled times.

<p>
The weighting for the laboratory assignments will be as follows:
<pre>
  Laboratory   Percentage of Course Grade
  Lab 0:           3%
  Lab 1:           8%
  Lab 2A:          7%
  Lab 2B:          6%
  Lab 3:           4%
</pre>
Note, the laboratory assignments are important.  Once a laboratory
turn-in date has arrived, material concerning that laboratory may
appear on an exam.

<p>
The grading for the entire course will be as follows:
<pre>
    Course Score    Grade
     [90 -- 100]      A
     [87 --  90)      A-
     [85 --  87)      B+
     [80 --  85)      B
     [77 --  80)      B-
     [75 --  77)      C+
     [70 --  75)      C
     [67 --  70)      C-
     [65 --  67)      D+
     [60 --  65)      D
     [ 0 --  60)      F
</pre>
Note the interval marks around the course-score column.  For example,
a course grade of B will be assigned if your semester grade is greater
than or equal to 80 and less than 85.  This also means that a course
grade of at least 67 needs to be achieved for this course to count
toward a UTCS degree.

<p>
The final exam will be given at the time
as <a href="http://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules/149/finals/index.html">
provided</a>, set by the UT Registrar.  Each time we teach this
course, we are told by a student that he/she needs to take the exam
early because of an existing airline reservation.  Please make sure
that your winter break travel plans start after the final exam.  If
you need to leave prior to to the final exam, then this is not the
course for you.
<p>

To the best of our current knowledge, the <b>final exams</b> are: 
<ul>
<li> Young's class:  Friday, December 12, 9am-noon, JES A121A
<li> Hunt's class:   Monday, December 15, 2-5pm, FAC 21 
</ul>
You should probably confirm this for yourself at the UT Registrar's website.<P>

The students that do well in this class are survivors.  This class is
a lot of work, and it is important to keep current.  The material in
this class is cumulative; it can be quite difficult to catch up if one
falls behind.  It is important to keep turing in homework, and
homework grades are our most reliable indicator of how well a student
will do in this class.  Note, it is important to show up for class, as
pop quizzes are given, and material not in the book may be discussed.
