<td> This course focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of
cryptography.  Mathematically precise notions of cipher security will
be presented.  The security properties of a wide variety of cipher
constructions will be rigorously analyzed, using tools related to
pseudorandom structures and number theory.  The following major topics
will be covered: classical cryptography, private-key encryption,
message authentication codes, collision-resistant hash functions,
practical and theoretical constructions of private-key primitives,
number theory, cryptographic hardness assumptions, public-key
encryption, digital signatures, and secret sharing.  See
the <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> for a more detailed lecture
plan.

consisting of textbook exercises.  You should not turn in solutions to
these exercises, as they will not be graded.  Sample solutions will be
provided.  Working on these exercises will help you to prepare for the
quizzes and tests.

<td>
There will be a short quiz in almost every class, except for the first
day and the two test days.  Each quiz will be closed book and closed
notes.  If you miss a quiz for any reason (legitimate or otherwise),
you will get a zero for that quiz.  However, when we compute your quiz
average at the end of the semester, we will throw out roughly the
bottom third of your quiz scores.  To be more precise, if there are
<i>k</i> quizzes, then your quiz average will be computed as the
average of your highest &lfloor;<i>2k/3</i>&rfloor; quiz scores.

There will be two in-class tests.  The tests will be closed book and
closed notes, except that one page of notes will be allowed (both
sides may be used).  The first test will be held on <b>Wednesday,
October 18</b>.  The second test will be held on <b>Monday, December
11</b>.  Please try to arrive in class a few minutes early on the test
dates; this will allow us to start the test right at the beginning of
the class period.
