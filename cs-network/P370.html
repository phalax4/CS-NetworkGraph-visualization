<H2><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Objectives</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are three primary objectives for the course:

<ul>
<li> To provide a broad survey of AI and Intelligent Systems
<li> To develop a deeper understanding of several major topics in AI
<li> To develop the design and programming skills that will help you to build intelligent artifacts 
</ul>
<P>

The course is designed to present a solid entry point to the field of
artificial intelligence.  It will provide the foundation to go on to
take other upper division AI courses.  For those students with
interest, it could possibly lead to subsequent research opportunities.


<H2><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
Content</A>
</H2>

<P>
There is no generally accepted definition of "artificial intelligence."
Some that have been proposed include:
<ul>
<li> The science of getting computers to do the things they can't do yet.
<li> Finding fast algorithms for NP-hard problems.
<li> Getting computers to do the things they do in the movies.
</ul>
<P>
This course provides a broad introduction to artificial intelligence.
Topics include:

<UL>
<LI>problem solving, including search and game playing
</LI>
<LI>knowledge and reasoning, including inference
</LI>
<LI>planning
</LI>
<LI>reasoning under uncertainty
</LI>
<LI>machine learning

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Written responses to readings (15%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Weekly
readings will be posted on the class website on Tuesday to be due the
following week.  Associated with some of the readings will be questions
that should be answered with concise, well-thought-out, coherent
written responses by email to the instructor and the TA.  The email
should be <b>in plain ascii text in the body of the email (not an
attachment)</b>. Please use the subject line "class readings for [due
date]".  In many cases, no specific questions will be posted.  In
those cases, the responses should be free form. Credit will be based on
evidence that you have done the readings carefully.  Acceptable
responses include (but are not limited to):
   <menu>
   <li> Insightful questions;
   <li> Clarification questions about ambiguities;
   <li> Comments about the relation of the reading to previous readings;
   <li> Critiques; 
   <li> Thoughts on what you would like to learn about in more detail;
   <li> Possible extensions or related studies; 
   <li> Thoughts on the reading's importance; and
   <li> Summaries of the most important things you learned.
   </menu>

These responses will be graded on a 10-point scale and graded mostly
on coherence and evidence of careful thought (most questions will not
have a ``right'' answer).  Answers will be due by 8pm the night
before the class the associated reading is due (Monday or Wednesday
night).  Responses received between then and 9:30a.m. on the class day
will be deducted 1 point (for a maximum score of 9).  Responses
received between then and 9:30a.m. the following class day will be
deducted 2 points (for a maximum score of 8).  Responses received
after that will be deducted 4 points (for a maximum score of 6).

<P>
These deadlines are designed both to encourage you to do the readings
before class and also to allow us to incorporate some of your
responses into the class discussions.

<DT><STRONG> Class participation (10%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
Students are expected to be present in class having completed the
readings and participate actively in the discussions.
</DD><p>

<!--
<DT><STRONG> Oral presentation/discussion moderation (10%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
Each student will be expected to lead a discussion on one of the
readings.  The discussion can begin with a brief summary/overview of
the important points in the readings, but the assumption is to be that
everyone has already completed the readings.  The student may either
present material related to the readings (perhaps from an outside
source) or moderate a class discussion about the readings.  In the
latter case, the student must be prepared to keep the conversation
flowing.  Here are some <a href="discussion-tips.txt">tips on leading
a discussion</a>. <br>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000100000000000000000">
Extension Policy</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you turn in your assignment late, expect points to be deducted.  No
exceptions will be made for the written responses to readings-based
questions (subject to the ``notice about missed work due to religious
holy days'' below).  For other assignments, extensions will be
considered on a case-by-case basis, but in most cases they will not be
granted.  

<P> For the penalties on responses to the readings see above (under
course requirements).  For other assignments, by default, 5 points
(out of 100) will be deducted for lateness, plus an additional 1 point
for every 24-hour period beyond 2 that the assignment is late.  For
example, an assignment due at 12:30pm on Tuesday will have 5 points
deducted if it is turned in late but before 12:30pm on Thursday.  It will
have 6 points deducted if it is turned in by 12:30pm Friday, etc.

<P>
The greater the advance notice of a need for an extension, the greater
the likelihood of leniency.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000110000000000000000">
Academic Dishonesty Policy</A>
</H2>

<P> You are encouraged to discuss the readings and concepts with classmates.  But
all written work must be your own.  And programming assignments must
be your own except for 2-person teams when teams are authorized.  All work
ideas, quotes, and code fragments that originate from elsewhere must
be cited according to standard academic practice. Students caught
cheating will automatically fail the course.  If in doubt, look
at the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html#honesty">departmental
guidelines</a> and/or ask.
<p>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000120000000000000000">
Notice about students with disabilities</A>
</H2>

<P>
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate
academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities.  To
determine if you qualify, please contact the Dean of Students at
471-6529; 471-4641 TTY.  If they certify your needs, I will work with
you to make appropriate arrangements.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000130000000000000000">
Notice about missed work due to religious holy days</A>
</H2>

<P>
A student who misses an examination, work assignment, or other project
due to the observance of a religious holy day will be given an
opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after
the absence, provided that he or she has properly notified the
instructor.  It is the policy of the University of Texas at Austin
that the student must notify the instructor at least fourteen days
prior to the classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent to
observe a religious holy day.  For religious holy days that fall
within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given
on the first day of the semester.  The student will not be penalized
for these excused absences, but the instructor may appropriately
respond if the student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed
assignment or examination within a reasonable time after the excused
absence.
