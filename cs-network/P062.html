<BR><BR><HR><BR>

<H3>Course Description:</H3> CS429 is the first course in the systems
core sequence required of all UT CS majors.  It describes how
computers operate at a fairly low level of abstraction.  
For example, we'll consider:
<UL>
<li> What are the components of a computer and how do they fit together?
<LI> How do computers do arithmetic?
<li> How does the code you write actually execute?
<li> How does a program in a high level language like C get translated
  into a form the machine can execute?
<li> How is information stored and accessed?
<li> How can you write code likely to execute efficiently?
<!-- <li> How does your program access existing "libraries"? -->
</UL>
<i>Understanding these fundamentals thoroughly is absolutely essential
to your future success in computer science.</i>  The material of this
course is quite detailed and requires careful and diligent study. If
you are not willing to put in the time and effort required to master
this material, you probably should reconsider your decision to major
in Computer Science.<P>

The UT College of Natural Sciences recently published <i>Vision and
      Recommendations for 21st Century Undergraduate Education</i>
      (June, 2016).  It contains these words:
<blockquote>
"Research on learning shows that transformative education requires
teaching methods that engage students in productive intellectual
struggles. Students must personally grapple with scientific and
mathematical concepts to develop a deep understanding of core
principles. They must be given opportunities to overcome obstacles and
failure to develop an acceptance of ambiguity and a willingness to
persevere." 
</blockquote>
In this class, you won't succeed unless you do some struggling,
grappling and persevering, and <i>accept ambiguity</i>!  Not
everything will be spelled out for you and there are a number of
skills you'll have to acquire on your own.

You will be asked to complete some very challenging assignments.  In
some cases you will be expected to use tools and techniques that are
not discussed in class.  That is not to say that help is not
available; just that we expect you to be proactive about learning.
This is a skill you must acquire now, because you'll need it for your
entire academic and professional career.  <i>Toto, I don't think we're in
high school anymore!</i><P>

The students that do well in this class are survivors. This class is a
lot of work, and it is important to keep current. The material in this
class is cumulative; it can be quite difficult to catch up if you fall
behind. It is important to keep turning in homework and coming to
class.  Here are some general hints for succeeding in this and other
classes:
<A HREF="how-to-succeed-in-cs429.html">Hints for Success.</A>
<P>

We will be discussing several different programming languages in this
course: C, x86 assembly language, and Y86 assembly language.  You will
be writing programs in at least C and x86. <P>

If you want to know what this course is like, I suggest you watch
  this short video: <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXc5ltzKq3Y">An Apt Metaphor
  for CS429.</A><P>

<H3>Weekly Discussion Sections:</H3>

Students are encouraged to attend a weekly discussion section, but
it's not terribly important which you attend.  They will mainly be
help sessions.  Note that the Friday sections run from 9am to 4pm.
<i>They will all be in UTC 4.112, not in the rooms listed in the
course schedule.</i>  You are welcome to drop in at any time during
the day.<P>

<b>Using Piazza:</b> We will be using Piazza for class
communication. The Piazza system is highly catered to getting you help
quickly and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather
than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post
your questions on Piazza. <b>Don't post code and other items on Piazza
that give away solutions to homework or labs, unless you post them
privately (visible only to yourself and the instructors.)</b><P>

<b>If you turn off the notifications and miss an important posting,
you are responsible.</b> If you have any problems or feedback for the
developers, email team at piazza.com.  <i>Because of some issues in
past semesters, posts may be anonymous to the class, but not to the
instructors.  I expect that posts will be pertinent and respectful.
Don't use Piazza as a place to vent or trash anyone.</i>  Please
don't waste everyone's time posting jokes and other fluff.<P>

<H3>Prerequisites:</H3> You are expected to have taken and passed the
following courses (or equivalent) with a grade of at least C-:
Computer Science 311 (or 313K) or 311H (or 313H); and Computer Science
314 (or 315) or 314H (or 315H).  If you don't have the prerequisites,
be sure to clear it with the CS department or risk being dropped from
the class.<P>

<H3>Text:</H3> The required text book for this class is <i>Computer
Systems, A Programmer's Perspective</i> by Randal E. Bryant and David
O'Hallaron, Prentice Hall, 2016 (Third Edition).  <i>You must have
the 3rd edition, which is substantially different from the 2nd
edition.</i> Note that this book is also used in CS439, so <i>don't
sell it back at the end of the semester</i> if you plan on continuing
in CS.<P>

Since we will be programming some in C, I recommend that you have
access to <i>The C Programming Language</i>, second edition, by Brian
Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, Prentice Hall Software Series.  This is
available on-line.  There are also many Web pages devoted to
C-language programming.  A nice tutorial intro to C is here: 
<A HREF="C_tutorial.pdf">C Tutorial</A>.  Java programmers should have
no problem with the subset of C that we will use.<P>

<H3>Class Schedule and Slides:</H3>
The class schedule is here: 
<A HREF="429schedule.pdf">schedule</A>.
<i>This schedule is approximate; some dates may change.  Rely on the
  assignment handouts, not on this schedule for assignment due
  dates.</i>  

<P>

All of the class slides will be made available via links below as we
cover new material.  You are welcome to print them out or view them
on-line.  Slides are in PDF form.  They are derived from slides
originally developed for the course by Bryant and O'Hallaron and
modified by me and other professors. They are used with permission.<P>

<h3>No Laptops:</h3>

If you want to use laptops, cell phones, or other electronic devices,
please step out of the class.  In previous semesters I've had
complaints from students that use of laptops was distracting to other
students.<P>

<h3>Videos:</h3>

For the past two semesters, I have been making some videos that you
might find helpful.  Generally, they cover small snippets of class
material that some students find confusing.  I'll make them available
over the course of the semester as we address the related topics.<P>

<P>

<H3>Tests:</H3> There will be three in-class exams of approximately
one and one half hours each. See the schedule for dates.  <i>There
will be no makeups on in-class exams,</i> but I will drop the lowest
of these three scores.  Exams are cumulative but will focus very
heavily on the material since the previous exam.<P>

We will have a combined final exam, meaning that both classes will
take it at the same time.  The final exam <i>is optional for anyone
who has taken all three in-class exams and is willing to take the
(normalized) average of all three exams as their final exam score.</i>
It will be held Thursday, December 14 from 7-10pm.  I don't yet know
the location.

<P>

Your exam grades is computed as follows: If you take all three
in-class exams and are happy with the average (of all three), you can
substitute that for the final exam score. For example, suppose you
receive (normalized) scores of 100, 90, and 80 on the three exams.
Your average for the in-class exams is 95 (dropping the lowest score
of 80), which counts 30% of your grade.  If you choose not to take the
final exam, your score on that is 90 (the average of all three), which
counts 20% of your grade. If you skip any of the in-class exams, you
must take the final.
<I>If you do take the final, the score on that test will be
your final exam score, no matter how well you did on the in-class
exams.</i> I.e., taking the final exam could lower your grade.<P>

<!-- The final exam is scheduled for May 11, 7-10pm in CLA 0.126.  Most of
probably will opt-out.  But if you decide to take it and have a
documented conflict, we can arrange an alternative time, <i>which may
not be the makeup time listed by the registrar</i>.  Don't just assume
that you can show up at the posted makeup time and that someone will
be there to give you the test.  Please discuss with me if you think
you might have to take the final and you have a documented
conflict.<P> -->

We also will have a few (around 6) pop quizzes over the course of the
semester.  They will be counted along with the 15% of your grade from
weekly homeworks.  There will be no makeup for quizzes, but they
individually count very little, so don't freak out if you miss one.
Quizzes may cover any material we've covered previously in the class,
but will usually only cover recent material.
<P>

<H3>Assignments:</H3> Written homework will be assigned nearly every
week.  They're due by the end of day (midnight).  Answers must be
submitted on Canvas and will not be accepted late.  You may discuss
written assignments with classmates and get help from the instructors;
but submit your own work.  This is an easy portion of your grade so
make the most of it.<P>

You will have around 5-6 labs over the course of the semester.  <i>You
must work alone on all labs.</i>  The due dates will be clearly
marked.  For labs, you will have 3 total grace days available which
you can use over the course of the semester.  You'd do well to save
them as long as possible to deal with illnesses and personal
emergencies. <P>

When you get your lab and homework grades, please check them
carefully.  If there's an error call it to our attention.  We expect
that after a week the grades will be final, unless there is a real
issue.<P>

<!-- Next time, definitely swap Labs 2 and 3.  Compiler lab and then the
Bomb Lab.     -->

<b>Labs are generally posted on Canvas and Piazza.</b><P>

<H3>Getting help:</h3> It is a good idea to post your questions on
Piazza, so that others can comment and also see the answer. General
questions and questions about tests can be directed to Dr. Young.  The
TAs manage and grade the labs and are your best source of information
on those.  Weekly homeworks are generally graded by the proctor;
direct your questions there for homeworks.  

<H3>Attendance:</H3> You are strongly encouraged to come to class.
Attendance will not be checked, but my experience suggests strongly
that students who regularly miss class do poorly.<P>

<H3>Computation of Your Grade:</H3>
The weighting of the grades for the various aspects of the course are
as follows: 
<P> 

<table border=1 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=5>
  <tr valight="top">
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><I>Component</i></td>
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><I>Percent</i></td>
  </tr>
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">In class exams (one dropped) <TH>30%
  <TR> <TH align="left" ALIGN="Left">Final Exam <TH>20%
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">Homework and Quizzes<TH>15%
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">Labs  <TH>35%
</TABLE><BR> 

Canvas attempts to compute a running average course grade as
  individual scores are entered. <b>You should totally ignore
  that.</b> I'm not making any effort to get Canvas to weight things
  appropriately, drop low scores, etc.  If you want to know how you're
  doing in the class, compute the score yourself.<P>

Grades for the entire course tentatively will be averaged using the
weighting below:
<P> 

<table border=1 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=5>
  <tr valight="top">
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><I>Course score</i></td>
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><I>Grade</i></td>
  </tr>
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[90...100]<th>A
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[87... 90)<th>A-
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[85... 87)<th>B+
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[80... 85)<th>B
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[77... 80)<th>B-
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[75... 77)<th>C+
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[70... 75)<th>C
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[67... 70)<th>C-
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[65... 67)<th>D+
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[60... 65)<th>D
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[ 0... 60)<th>F
</table>
<P>
This is tentative.  The grades may be curved and may be a bit more
generous than this.  <i>They will not be less generous.</i> That is,
if you have a 90 you are guaranteed an A; but somone who gets an 89
may also get an A, depending on the final distribution of grades in
the class.<P>

A course grade of at least C- is required for this course to count
toward a UT CS degree.<P>

<H3>Scholastic Dishonesty:</H3> Academic dishonesty will not be
tolerated.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct</A>
for an excellent summary of expectations of a student in a CS
class.<P>

All work must be the student's own effort.  <I>Work by students in
previous semesters is not your own effort.  Don't even think about
turning in such work as your own, or even using it as a basis for your
work.  We have very sophisticated tools to find such cheating and we
use them routinely.</I> It's far better to get a 0 on an assignment
than to cheat.<P>

<b>Also, don't post your work on any publicly available site, such as
GitHub or Course Hero.</b>  It's understandable that you're proud of
your work, but this just invites copying for students this semester
and in subsequent semesters.  If someone copies your work, even
without your knowledge, you will both be liable to punishment.  Here's
what Mike Scott said when I mentioned this issue to him:
<blockquote>
I have submitted cases to Student Judicial Services for past students
who have posted code from CS314 and CS312 to public repos and current
students used it to cheat. Not much SJS can do grade wise, but it is
recorded and they often have to write an essay about the matter.
</blockquote>
I plan to follow Mike's lead here.  There are other services such as
BitBucket that have private repositories; you can grant selective
access to instructors and to potential employers.<P>

<i>Also, don't repost my slides or any other class materials on
  CourseHero or any other public repository.  Consider all course
  materials to be copyright.  You can get into serious legal problems
  violating copyright laws, and you will certainly have problems with
  me if you do this.</i><P>

No deviation from the standards of scholastic honesty or professional
integrity will be tolerated.  Scholastic dishonesty is a serious
violation of UT policy; and will likely result in an automatic F in
the course and may result in further penalties imposed by the
department or by the university.  <i>Don't do it!</i>  If you are
caught, you will regret it.  And even if you're not caught, you're
still a cheater.<P>

<H3>Students with Disabilities:</H3> 

Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community
Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259,
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd. <P>

Typically, students allowed extra time or a quiet testing environment
will take exams in a conference room on GDC 7S at the same time as the
regular exam.  One of the TAs will proctor.
<b>If you are allowed such accommodations, get me your SSD letter well
  in advance of the test since I will need to arrange a TA to proctor
  your test.</b>  Please be flexible with respect to time, etc.<P>

<H3>Grad Students Clearing Architecture Background Requirement</H3>

If you're a grad student who needs to complete your background
requirement in Architecture by exam, I'm happy to help you with that.
You can do as little as take the final exam for CS429 with a grade of
at least 80%.  But be aware that the exams for this class (or any
class) are idiosyncratic and assume that the person taking the test is
also taking the class.  For example, there are questions about the x86
ISA.  You could be a world-class expert on the MIPS or ARM
architecture and not do well on the exam.  My suggestion is to study
the appropriate sections of the Bryant and O'Hallaron book, review the
class slides, and take the three in-class exams.  BTW: the final is
optional for students in the class who take all three in-class exams.
I'll give you the same option.  If you get 80% average on the three
in-class exams, I'll count that as clearing your background
requirement.  That's probably safer than rolling the dice and just
taking the final.<P>
