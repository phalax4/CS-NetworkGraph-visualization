<P>

<H3> Addressing: </H3>
Consider the following declarations:
<PRE>
     type complex = record  re, im: real  end;

          item  = record name:      alfa;
                         age:       integer;
                         location:  complex;
                         displayed: boolean;
                         color:     array[(red,green,blue)] of integer;
                         link:      ^item;
                         cost:      real     end;

     var items = array [ 8..12, (low, med, hi), 7..11] of item;
</PRE>

<UL>
<LI> Assuming <TT>integer</TT> and <TT>boolean</TT> are 4 bytes
and <TT>alfa</TT>, pointers, and <TT>real</TT> are 8 bytes,
how much storage is occupied by the array <TT>items</TT>?

<LI> Show the intermediate code for the expression:
<PRE>
   items[10, hi, 8].link^.color[blue]
</PRE>
Show how it was derived and give the <TT>aref</TT> form.
</UL>

<H3> Other Questions:</H3>
<UL>
<LI> A robot moves on a square grid.  The robot can go forward (f),
turn left (l), or turn right (r).
Give a grammar to describe the language of all sequences of moves that
leave the robot pointing in the same direction as when it started.
<LI> What kind of grammar is the above (in the Chomsky hierarchy)?

<LI> Describe a kind of local optimization.

<LI> Describe what it means for a subexpression to be (a) available,
(b) busy, (c) killed.

<LI> Describe sources of extra run-time overhead in (a) time and (b) space
in an object-oriented language.

<LI> Draw boxes around the following code to show the basic blocks:
<PRE>
   n := k*2;
   if n < j then write('less')
            else begin k := k - 1; write('more') end;
   writeln(k);
</PRE>
Number the blocks and draw a flow graph; give the matrix form of the
flow graph and its transitive closure.

<LI> Give an advantage and a disadvantage for (a) call by reference
(b) call by value.

<LI> What are the most important things to optimize in a scientific
program?  Why?

<LI> Give three examples of computer architecture innovations that
require compiler innovations to be effective.

<LI> Briefly and clearly define the following terms: ...  20 terms chosen
from the vocabulary list on the study guide.
