<h1 align="center">Pair and Group Programming Standards and Requirements</h1>
<br>

<hr>
<p align="left">In CS439, you will complete the beginning projects
with a partner, and later projects will be completed in your teams of
four.  Programming with a partner or in a group is a great tool to
help learn how to program and solve problems.
</p>

<p align="left">Pair programming means working on an assignment
together, sitting at the same computer. One person drives (types at
the keyboard) while the other person sits next to the driver while
observing, commenting, and making suggestions to the driver. This form
of programming can speed up the programming process by having a helper
immediately available.  It also reduces the likelihood of syntax and
design errors, as there are two pairs of eyes watching for
mistakes. If the driver tries out a flawed solution, the partner is
there to provide constructive criticism and helpful alternatives.
Pair programming does not mean taking an assignment and partitioning
into two pieces and then having each person complete a piece.  
</p>
<p>
Group programming is very similar, except now one person drives while
the others observe, comment, and make suggestions.  Everyone present
should get a chance to drive, and the driver should change every 30
minutes. <!--Hahahaha.  Driver should change.-->
</p>
<p>
Here are the requirements for pair and group programming in this course:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
 Every team member present must act as a driver, and the driver
must change every 30 minutes.
</li>
<p>
<li>
<p>
At least 80% of your time must be spent working together at one
computer.
</li>
<p>
<li> 
<p>
Within the code place comments stating who was driving when the code was written. Example:
<pre>
#Michael driving now
def main():    x = 0;
   y = 0;
   # more code

# end of Michael driving, Kelly driving now 
</pre>
<p>
(except your code should be in C!)
<p>
For blocks of code where more than one person drove, your comment may
state something like:
<pre>
#Michael and Kelly drove here
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>
<p align="left"> Maintain a log that records the date and time you
work on your project, which team members were working on the project,
and which team member was driving (typing).  Example:</p>

<p align="left">9/17, 9:30a - 11:45a Michael, Kelly, Clare, and Emily, 2.25 hours<br />
Driver Order and Time Length:<br /> 
Michael, 30 minutes<br />
Clare, 30 minutes<br />
Emily, 30 minutes<br />
Kelly, 30 minutes<br />
Michael, 15 minutes
</p>
<p>
9/17, 7:30p - 9:00p, Michael and Kelly, 1.5 hours<br />
Driver Order and Time Length:<br />
Kelly, 30 minutes<br />
Michael, 30 minutes<br />
Kelly, 30 minutes
</p>
<p>
9/18, 8:00a - 11:00a, Michael, Kelly, Clare, and Emily, 3 hours<br />
Driver Order and Time Length:<br />
Clare, 30 minutes<br />
Emily, 30 minutes<br />
Michael, 30 minutes<br />
Kelly, 30 minutes<br />
Clare, 30 minutes<br />
Emily, 30 minutes<br />
</p>
<p>
9/18, 7:00p - 8:30p, Clare and Emily, 1.5 hours<br />
Driver Order and Time Length:<br />
Clare, 30 minutes<br />
Emily, 30 minutes<br />
Clare, 30 minutes<br />
</p>
<!-- <p align="left">In your log, also record the problems and challenges
you encountered on the assignment. What was particularly difficult?
On which parts of the assignment did you need outside help?</p>-->

<p align="left">Unless a log file has been provided for you, name your
file <tt>pair_programming_log.txt</tt> and turned in with the rest of your
materials.  (<tt>make turnin</tt> will do this for you automatically.)  For the
  Pintos projects, an appropriately named file is included in each project
  directory.   Use that file.
