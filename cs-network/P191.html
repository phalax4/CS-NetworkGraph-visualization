available in CS312</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="5">CS312 is a large class and you, the students, are responsible 
for a lot, including knowing you need help and seeking out that help. </font> </p>
<p align="left"><font size="5">Here are the resources that are available to you.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../index.htm"><font size="5">The class web page</font></a><font size="5">: The web page contains the
  <a href="../syllabus.htm">syllabus</a>, <a href="../schedule.htm">schedule</a> 
  with slides, and <a href="../assignments/index.htm">assignments</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font size="5"><a href="https://piazza.com/class/j6f6hpuiaja57q">Post a question on the 
  class discussion group</a>:

  other people do to. </font> </li>
  <li><font size="5">
  <a href="mailto:scottm@cs.utexas.edu?subject=CS312 Question - ">Email the instructor</a>: (or the

  </a>for CS312. Don't wait for the last minute to try and 
  get help from these tutors. The UT Learning Center <b>does not</b> offer drop 
  in tutoring for CS312, so you need to be proactive and sign up for a tutor if 
  you even think you may need help.</font></li>
  <li><font size="5">Helping yourself. To know whether you need help or not you must do the 
  readings, try to do the suggested exercises from the book (listed on the class
  <a href="../schedule.htm">schedule</a>) and attempt the Practice It and 
   
  listed on the class schedule.</font></li>
