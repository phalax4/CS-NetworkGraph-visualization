 Here are some tips that may save you a bit of time:
  <ul>
  <li>Whenever they talk about regulatory agencies (such as the
  FDA): skim those paragraphs.</li>
  <li>Skip starting at p35 (specifically the paragraph beginning "The second
  item"), and start reading again on p38 ("Lessons
  learned").</li>
  <li>Skip the part on pp40-41 with the header "User and
  government oversight and standards", and start reading again on p41 with
  "Most previous accounts".</li>
    </ul>
