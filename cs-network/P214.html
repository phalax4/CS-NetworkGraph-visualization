1. Design a code C that consists of three codewords such that if the number 
of inverted bits in a codeword is at most 4 then the bit inversion in the
codeword, if any, is detected.

Solution:

The smallest distance h between any two codewords in C needs to be more than 4.

Choose h to be 5.

Thus, the three codewords in C can be:

00000000
11111000
00111111

2. What is the maximum number n of inverted bits, that can be corrected, in a
codeword in your code C. 

Solution:

n is less than h/2 which equals 2.5 for the above code C.

Thus, n = 2.
