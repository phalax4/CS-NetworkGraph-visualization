<H2>CS378 Assignment 1 </H2>

<P><B>Due:</B> Friday, Feb. 6 at class time;  bring a hard copy to
  class (send it electronically if you won't be in class).<P>

<B>Note you can work with one other student on this project.  If you
  so, be sure to identify both members of the team and include a
  sentence explaining the contributions of each. </B><P>

Consider the various definitions/characterizations of Information
Assurance given in the first part of slideset 1.  Write your own
definition of Information Assurance.  Explain how your definition
relates to or encompasses the following:
<ul>
<li> the ISO/IEC aspects of software quality (slide 5);
<li> Raggad's conceptual resources (slide 8);
<li> the DoD aspects of information needing protection (slide 11);
<li> Herrmann's security engineering domains (slide2 13ff).
</ul>
There is no page limit, but I'd guess that this shouldn't take more
than about 3 pages.  Use the information from the slides;  you don't
have to read (or cite) the source documents behind these.

<h3>Grading Information:</h3> This and subsequent writing assignments
will be graded on the following criteria:
<ol>
<li> Did you do the assignment as specified?
<li> Did you give it adequate thought and care? 
<li> Is your argument well reasoned and supported by evidence?
<li> Is the document formatted reasonably?  (It's better short than
  padded.)
<li> Are references cited correctly?
<li> Is the writing style acceptable? 
</ol>

We're not grading on grammar or spelling, but you should make a
credible effort to write in a style worthy of a student at a top-tier
university.
