<h2><b>Discussion Section Problem Set 3<br></b></h2>
<h3><b> Due in Section on Friday, September 22, 2017 </h3></b>
</center>
The problem set must be completed before section and brought to section.  To
ensure that your problem set is turned in correctly and that you receive credit
for discussion section, you must follow these guidelines exactly.

<ul>
<li>Include the following header at the top of your file:
<pre>
Discussion Section Problem Set #: 
Student Name:
EID:
CS login:
Email address:
Unique Number: 
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>You may either type your answers or write them by hand, but you must bring a
  hard copy to discussion section.
  </li>
<p>
<li>
   In discussion section, your TA will check that you make a good effort on the
problem set and that you are participating in the discussions in section and
ready and able to answer when called upon.  If all of those are true, you will
receive credit for discussion section that day.  Note that a "good effort" on
the problem set includes that all answers are in your own words and <i>not</i>
copied from anywhere else, including the slide deck.
</li>
</ul>

<!--Number One--->
<li>
When executing system or library calls from multi-threaded code,
  it is important to know which calls are <i>re-entrant</i> and which
  are not. <ul><li> What is the meaning of <i>re-entrant</i>?</li><li>
  How does a re-entrant call behave differently from a call that is
  not re-entrant?  </li><li>Why is this an important consideration for
  multi-threaded code?</li></ul>

<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Two--->
<li>
What does the function <tt>pthread_detach()</tt> do?  What default
behavior of threads does it alter?  When might it be useful?
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Three--->
<li>
Consider a uniprocessor kernel that user programs can trap into using
system calls.  The kernel receives and handles interrupts from I/O
devices.  Would there be any need for critical sections within that
kernel?
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!--Number Four--->
<li>
Describe the priority inversion problem and give an example
situation where it may occur.
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Five--->
<li>
In the code below, indicate where each variable is stored (e.g.,
stack, heap, static data segment), and whether that variable would be
shared by the threads in a multi-threaded program.  If applicable,
indicate where the space that variable points to is allocated.
<p>
<pre>
int i;    
char * j; 

void foo(int a){

   int b;          
   static float c; 

   /*do stuff*/
}

int main(int argc, char**argv){

   int * m; 
   int g;   
   double z; 

   j = malloc(MAXBUF*sizeof(char));  

   createThread(0, foo(), 2);
   createThread(1, foo(), 4);

   /*do stuff*/
}
