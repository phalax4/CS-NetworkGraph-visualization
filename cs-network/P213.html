1. Consider a file that is written using five different symbols. The number of
occurrences of the first symbol in the file is (2^8), and the number of 
occurrences of each of the other four symbols in the file is (2^6). Under the
assumption that this file is encoded using a Huffman Code, compute the total 
number of bits needed to encode the file. (Read the symbol "^" as "to the power
of".)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Using Shannon Theorem, compute the smallest number of bits needed to encode
the file in Problem 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. A sender and a receiver use a Lempel-Ziv code to transmit a file from the
sender to the receiver. Initially, the dictionary in the sender has only one 
entry (index 0, <empty string>). What will the dictionary in the sender be 
after the sender transmits the following sequence: 
		(0, a), (0, b), (2, b), (3, b), (4, b), (5, a)? 
What is the string of symbols that the sender transmits by this sequence?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Let X, Y, and Z be three dependent sets of k-bit words, for some k. Assume
that a word w is removed from set X and added to set Y, changing both X and Y 
to become X' and Y' respectively. Later a word w' is removed from set Y' and 
added to set Z, changing both Y' and Z to become Y" and Z' respectively. We 
are given only the final three sets X', Y", and Z', how can we check whether 
the two words w and w' are equal?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Design a code that consists of 4 codewords, where each codeword has k bits
for some k. The designed code is required to satisfy the condition: if the 
number of bit inversions in a codeword is at most 2, then the bit inversion in
the codeword, if any, can be corrected. Make sure that the number k of bits in
each codeword in your code is as small as possible.   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. A sender uses public/private cryptography to encrypt a file before sending
the file to a receiver. Assume that in this case the public and private keys 
are computed using the parameters p = 3 and q = 11. Compute the public and 
private keys in this case. (Hint: compute e to be the smallest prime number 
that does not divide PHI(n), and compute d by inspection.) Assume that the file
to be sent is "abbbbba" where symbol "a" is represented by the integer 01 and 
symbol "b" is represented by the integer 02. What is the encrypted file?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

7. Is it easy to deduce the private key from the public key in Problem 6 ?
Explain your answer.

Solutions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. 2^9 
    |
    |
    |------------------2^8
    |
   2^8------2^7--------2^6
       |     |
       |     |---------2^6
       |
       |
       |----2^7--------2^6
             |
             |---------2^6

Each occurrence of the first symbol is encoded using 1 bit, and each occurrence
of any of the other four symbols is encoded using 3 bits.

The total number of bits needed to encode the file	= 1.(2^8) + 3.4.(2^6)
						   	= 2^8 + 3.(2^8)
						   	= 4.(2^8)
						   	= (2^10) bits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. h = - [1/2 * log(1/2)   +    4 * 1/(2^3) * log(1/(2^3))]
     =   [1/2              +    3/2                       ]
     =   2

The smallest number of bits needed to encode the file	= 2 * (2^9)
							= (2^10) bits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Dictionary in sender is as follows 	-------------------
					Index	| String
					-------------------
					0       | empty
					1       | a
					2       | b
					3       | bb
					4       | bbb
					5       | bbbb
					6       | bbbba
      					-------------------
The sent string of symbols is a|b|bb|bbb|bbbb|bbbba
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Let +(X) denote the exclusive or applied to all the k-bit words in set X.
   w  = +(X')
   w' = +(Z')
   Thus, w = w' if and only if +(X') = +(Z')
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. The smallest distance h between any two codewords in the code needs to 
satisfy the condition 2 < h/2. In other words, h needs to be 5.

The four codewords in the code are as follows:	00000 000
						11111 000
						00111 111
						11000 111
(Note that the spaces are added to make reading the codewords easier.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. p = 3 and q = 11. Thus, n = 33 and PHI(n) = 20.
   Choose e to be 3 and d needs to be chosen such that 3*d mod 20 = 1.
   Thus, choose d to be 7. Public key = (3, 33) and Private key = (7, 33).

   To encrypt the file abbbbba, 
   encrypt each "a" by itself as (01)^3 mod 33 which equals 01
   encrypt each "b" by itself as (02)^3 mod 33 which equals 08

   Thus the file is encrypted as 01080808080801
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Yes it is easy to factorize 33 into the two primes 3 and 11 and so one
compute PHI(n) to be 20 and use both the given e and computed PHI(n) to compute
d (using the Extended Euclid Algorithm).
