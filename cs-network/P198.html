------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let T be the Huffman best tree generated using bag a B of frequency occurrences
where B = {.1, .1, .2, .3, .3}. Find another bag C of frequency occurrences, 
i.e.  C = {c0, c1, c2, c3, c4} and no ci is in B, such that the Huffman best
tree generated using C has the same structure as T.

Solution:

There are many solutions to this problem (as long as all the c's add up to 1 
and satisfy the stated requirement). And here is one of them:
C={0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.26, 0.29}.
