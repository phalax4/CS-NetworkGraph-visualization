<h2><b>Discussion Section Problem Set 8<br></b></h2>
<h3><b> Due in Section on Friday, November 3, 2017 </h3></b>
</center>
The problem set must be completed before section and brought to section.  To
ensure that your problem set is turned in correctly and that you receive credit
for discussion section, you must follow these guidelines exactly.

<ul>
<li>Include the following header at the top of your file:
<pre>
Discussion Section Problem Set #: 
Student Name:
EID:
CS login:
Email address:
Unique Number: 
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>You may either type your answers or write them by hand, but you must bring a
  hard copy to discussion section.
  </li>
<p>
<li>
   In discussion section, your TA will check that you make a good effort on the
problem set and that you are participating in the discussions in section and
ready and able to answer when called upon.  If all of those are true, you will
receive credit for discussion section that day.  Note that a "good effort" on
the problem set includes that all answers are in your own words and <i>not</i>
copied from anywhere else, including the slide deck.
</li>
</ul>

<!--Number One--->
<li>
  Question 6.3, page 595 (page 575 of the second edition), B&amp;O.

<!---Number Two--->
<li>
Which file allocation scheme that we studied is most similar to paging?
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Three--->
<li>
Susan would like to read the file <br><tt>
    /usr/susan/cs439/study_guide.txt</tt>.  Assuming she has the correct
  permissions and is using FFS, describe the steps the operating
  system would need to take to read the file.
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Five--->
<li>
How does a journaling file system maintain file system consistency
  even in the event of a crash?  Name an example of a journaling file
  system.
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!--Number Four--->
<li>
Consider a paging system with 16 pages and a page size of 256
  bytes.  The system has 1024 bytes of physical memory.
<ol>
<li>How many bits are in a physical address?
<li>How many bits represent the page number?
<li> How many bits are in the complete virtual address?
<li> What size are the page frames?
