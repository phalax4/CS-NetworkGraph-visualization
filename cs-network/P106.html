<h2><b>Discussion Section Problem Set 1<br></b></h2>
<h3><b> Due in Section on Friday, September 8, 2017 </h3></b>
</center>
The problem set must be completed before section and brought to section.  To
ensure that your problem set is turned in correctly and that you receive credit
for discussion section, you must follow these guidelines exactly.

<ul>
<li>Include the following header at the top of your file:
<pre>
Discussion Section Problem Set #: 
Student Name:
EID:
CS login:
Email address:
Unique Number: 
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>You may either type your answers or write them by hand, but you must bring a
  hard copy to discussion section.
  </li>
<p>
<li>
   In discussion section, your TA will check that you make a good effort on the
problem set and that you are participating in the discussions in section and
ready and able to answer when called upon.  If all of those are true, you will
receive credit for discussion section that day.  Note that a "good effort" on
the problem set includes that all answers are in your own words and <i>not</i>
copied from anywhere else, including the slide deck.
</li>
</ul>
<!-- Please refer to the
<a href="problem_set_turnin.html">problem set turnin instructions</a>.-->

<ol>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
<!--Number One--->
<li>
Create a name tent for use during all discussion sections this semester.  Your
name tent must be typed and your first name (or the name you would like to be
called) must be displayed in a font size of at least 78pt.  Your last name
should be on the next line and must be displayed in a font size of at least
48pt.  If you are unsure of either what a name tent is or how to create one,
many examples can be found using Google (probably the one and only time this
semester we will recommend Google).  Bring your name tent with you to discussion
section (there is no need to turn it in to Canvas).
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Two--->
<li>
While holding your name tent, capture a picture of yourself and upload it to the
Section 1 assignment in Canvas.  The picture must be appropriate, we must be
able to read the name tent and see your face, but the rest is up to you.
</li>
<p>
<!--Number Four--->
<li>
What are "privileged instructions"? Name three situations 
in which privileged instructions are required.
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Three--->
<li>
System Calls vs. Procedure Calls: 

How much more expensive is a system call than a procedure call? Write
a simple test program to compare the cost of a simple procedure call
to a simple system call (&quot;getuid()&quot; is a good candidate on
UNIX; see the man page.) (Note: be careful to prevent the optimizing
compiler from &quot;optimizing out&quot; your procedure calls. Do not
compile with optimization on.)
<ul>
<li>Explain the difference (if any) between the time required by your
simple procedure call and simple system call by discussing what work
each call must do (be specific). [Note: Do not provide the source code
for your program, just the results].
</ul>

<p><i>Hint:</i> You should use system calls such as <i>gethrtime()</i>
or <i>gettimeofday()</i> for time measurements. Design your code such
that the measurement overhead is negligible. Also, be aware that timer
values in some systems have limited resolution (e.g., millisecond
resolution).
<p>
</li>
<p>
<!---Number Five--->
<li>
Run the following command in your command line (it
generates 10k random integers less than 1000 and stores them in the num.txt
file.):

<pre>
$ for i in {1..10000}; do echo $(($RANDOM % 1000)); done > nums.txt
</pre>

Now, <i>without opening the file</i>, answer the following questions with both
a) the answer and b) the command you used to find the answer.

<ol>

<li> How many numbers containing 74 are in the file? </li>
<li> How many 12s are in nums.txt? </li>
<li> How many numbers in the file begin with 14?</li>

</ol>

<i>Hint:</i> You may find <tt>grep</tt> and <tt>wc</tt> useful---use their man
pages to learn more about them.  In addition, The Geek Stuff as a tutorial on <a
href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/03/15-practical-unix-grep-command-examples/">grep</a>
that you may find useful, and it also has a tutorial on <a
href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/01/regular-expressions-in-grep-command/">regular
expressions in the grep command</a>.
