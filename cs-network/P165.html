<h2>Course Objectives</h2>

<p>Students will study iOS APIs and learn to build significant
iOS applications.  The course will have a practical focus, with
significant programming assignments and a large group project.  While
the course focuses on iOS, we will focus on general principles of
software engineering and mobile app development.
</p>
<p>
The course assumes familiarity with programming and object oriented
terminology.  It does not assume previous experience with objective-c
or iOS programming.
</p>
<p>
We gratefully acknowledge use of materals from Stanford course CS 193P,
please see the full statement under Credit below.

<h3>Course Materials</h3>

<ul>

<li>iClickers might be required.
</ul>

<p><b>Readings.
<ul>
</b>There is no textbook for this course, however, I
highly recommend you get an iOS programming book.  When it comes to
educating yourself, I believe in an "all of the above" approach.  That
means attending lecture, discussing the material with your peers,
reading books, reading online sources, programming, experimenting,
reading official documentation, etc.
I've always found a book or two is a valuable part of learning.
</p>
<p>There are many excellent iOS programming books out there, and I
encourage you to visit your local bookstore and figure out which one
will work for you.  They have different approaches, for example, some
emphasize principles and some emphasize recipies.  You should judge
which approach works for your learning style.  One trick that I use when
evaluating a book is to have some specific question, like how does
this book explain auto layout using visual format constraints?  Then
see if the book has a reasonable answer to your question.
<p>
Some books that I found useful are Apress iOS 7 Development Recipies
and the O'Reilly iOS 7 Programming Cookbook.  Addison-Wesley's Cocoa
Design Patterns was illuminating, but again, please explore to
find out what works for you.
</p>
<p>
Some course content might be restricted to machines
<b>in the utexas.edu domain</b>.  I recognize that might be a bit
inconvenient, but just plan ahead.
</p>
</ul>
<p><b>In-class presentation</b>.  
<ul>
<li>During one of the final class meetings, each project 
  will present their programming project.</li>
</ul>

I have created CS 378 IOS Witchel in piazza (piazza.com) for this course
(<a href="https://piazza.com/class#spring2015/cs378ios/">link</a>).

<h3> Grading</h3>
<p>Your final grade for the course will be based on the following
approximate weights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>60-70% Class participation, in-class quizzes, homeworks</li>
  <li>10-20% Exam</li>
  <li>20-30% Project and presentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Policies</h2>

<h3>Collaboration</h3>

<p>Students are encouraged to talk to each other, to the course staff,
or to anyone else about any of the assignments.
Assistance must be limited to discussion of the problem and
sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write
out his or her own solutions to the homework.  NO collaboration on
homework implementation, you may only discuss general conepts. 
<b> You should identify all collaborators in writing in your homework.</b>
</p>
<p>
The department student code of conduct is <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/code-conduct">
here</a>.  Here is a nice quotation, "The University and the Department are committed to preserving the reputation of your degree. It means a lot to you. In order to guarantee that every degree means what it says it means, we must enforce a strict policy that guarantees that the work that you turn in is your own and that the grades you receive measure your personal achievements in your classes."
</p>
<p>If you are not
sure about whether some form of collaboration is acceptable, please ask.
</p>
<p>
Students may not acquire from any source (e.g., another student or an
internet site) a partial or complete solution to a problem or project
that has been assigned.  You <b>cannot</b> simply search for
homework/lab answers and turn that work in as your own.  If you do so,
you will be caught and you will get an F on the assignment and
possibly in the course.  I take academic honesty very seriously.
I will look for any form of cheating and if found, I will persue it,
and it will be painful for the guilty party.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Students are encouraged to pair up for projects</li>
<li>Each student must present, though partners can collaborate on a project presentation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Late Policy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All homeworks must be submitted in class the day they are due.
  </li>
  <li>You have three (3) slip days for you to use at your discretion
  throughout the semester.  Handing in a homework any time within 24 hours
  of its being due costs one slip day.  There is no grade penalty for
  using a slip day.  Once your slip days are used up, it is up to the
  discretion of the TA and instructor as to whether a late assignment
  is even graded.</li>
  </li>
  <li><i>If you become ill</i>:  Contact the instructor and get a
  medical note.  A medical note is required to miss an exam.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Independent Inquiry</h3>

<p>
This course carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry
courses are designed to engage you in the process of inquiry over the
course of a semester, providing you with the opportunity for
independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related
to your major. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of
your grade to come from the independent investigation and presentation
of your own work.
</p>
<p>
In particular, this course has a significant project and presentation
that forms a large part of your grade, and must be initiated and
directed by  you.
</p>
