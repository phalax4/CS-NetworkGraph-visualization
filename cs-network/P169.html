<p><b>Course Objectives</b></p><p>

The course is designed to give students a experience working with the
key technological components of a computer game. Students will build a
simple 3-d game engine out of existing public domain libraries and
will use this engine to create one or more games.  The result will be
a large software system that runs on multiple platforms, including
Windows and Linux.  Projects will be done in a team context in order
to allow students to gain experience working together with other
programmers on relatively large projects.  We will also expect
students to "fend for themselves" to an extent greater than that of
most other courses in the department.  This means we'll minimize the
amount of starter code and help with build environments that we
provide in order to encourage students to leverage online
resources and the expertise of colleagues to solve practical problems
in getting systems working from scratch.

</p><p><b>Student Evaluation</b></p><p>

Your performance in this class will be evaluated through a sequence of
projects of every greater complexity.  These will be done in 3 person
teams in most cases, with weekly milestones to be turned in by the
team for projects that take longer than a week.  There will be no
exams or non-programming homework.  Project grades will be assigned
to teams based on the quality and timeliness of the projects they deliver
as well as the quality of intermediate milestones in the project.  In order
to give individual grades, all students will evaluate their own and their
team members' performance on each project as part of turning it in.  This
feedback will be used to offset individual grades from the team grades as
appropriate.  Each project grade will be weighted in the final grade in
proportion to the fraction of the time in the semester it took.

</p><p>

There will be no final in the course.  Instead, we will use the 3 hour
final exam period to have a game demo festival in the lab.  We will
invite members of the local game industry to come and join us in
playing each of your games.  Evaluations by the invitees will be used
along with the professor and TAs evaluations as part of determining
your team's grade on the final game project.

</p><p>

Each team has a "late account" of 3 days for the term which it can
spend to mitigate late project deliveries.  For example, you can turn
in three projects one day late each, or one project 3 days late,
without penalty.  A project is late if it is not turned in by the
specified due date and time, with any fraction of a late day counted
as a full late day.  Once you have exhausted your late account, your
team will lose 33% of the maximum assignment grade for each additional
late day.  Thus, assignments will be worth 0 points after 3 additional
late days.  Since assignments build on each other, you'll still have
do to the work, so you might as well do it on time and get credit for
it.

</p><p>

<b>Academic Misconduct Policy</b></p><p>


You are free to discuss the course material, game designs and engine
architectures with your classmates and particularly your teammates.
Teams are expected to make clear their division of labor for each
project, and students are expected to do their own work on their portion
of the project.  Because these are team projects, we expect you to solicit
help from teammates when you're stuck or need help making design decisions.
Indeed, design decisions that impact interfaces to other team members parts
of the project should never be made without consulting the rest of the team.

</p><p>

Leverage of existing software to solve programming problems is explicitly
a goal of this course, unlike other courses in the department.  You are
free to use external software in your project provided that
</p><ul>
<li> You clearly have the right to use the software
non-commercially. You must not violate copyrights, software licensing
policies, or other terms and conditions of use.
</li><li> You have permission of the instructor or TA to use the software.
</li></ul>
Generally we will encourage appropriate use of open source libraries and
engines to solve your problems.  We are likely to frown the use of
on other kinds of external software, however.

University policy (see Dean of Students' <a href="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php"> policies on
academic integrity</a>) will be followed strictly.

<p>

Acts that exceed the bounds defined by the approved collaboration
practices will be considered cheating. Such acts include:

</p><ul>

<li>Copying solutions, code, or programs from someone else or giving
someone else your solutions, code, or programs, except insofar as
you are working together in a team.

</li><li>Participation in a discussion group that develops a solution that
everyone copies, again other than in a context of making team decisions
on project strategies.

</li></ul>


<b>Your Responsibilities in This Class:</b><p>

</p><ul>

<li>You are expected to show up on time for class.

</li><li>You are expected to sign up for the course on <em>piazza</em>.

</li><li>You are responsible for all material posted to the web site or
piazza.  Ignorance of such material is no excuse.

</li><li>You are responsible for obtaining a departmental Unix account, and
learning the Unix operating system sufficiently well to meet the
demands of the course. You can find on-line unix guides - the
department uses Ubuntu Linux.

</li><li>You are responsible for all material presented in lecture.

</li><li>You are expected to work with your team to produce the best
projects you can in a timely fashion.  These projects can require
a substantial time commitment, and you should never wait to start
work on a project.  This is not only likely to hurt you, it's unfair
to your team.  If you are going to have problems with time management
that you can foresee, work with your team and the instructor to 
plan for this.

</li><li>You are responsible for following
the university's policies on academic integrity.  See
above guidelines for more information on what is or is not allowed.

</li></ul>

<p>

<b>Other General Information</b></p><p>

The programming assignments will require use of the Department of
Computer Sciences instructional computing resources.  All CS students
should already have accounts on these machines.  If you do not already
have such an account, you can obtain one for the class <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/computing/"> here</a>.
Other important information about facilities, including where the labs
now are in the new building:

</li><li><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/faq/">UTCS computing
FAQ</a> </li></ul> <p> Please note that the machines that we are using for
this course are the 64bit linux machines with high end graphics cards.
These machines are in the namespaces <tt>kol64</tt>,
<tt>nethack64</tt>, or <tt>candy64</tt>, you can find out the names of
suitable machines to use by issuing the command <tt>cshosts kol64</tt>,
<tt>cshosts nethack64</tt>, or <tt>cshosts candy64</tt> at any public
cs linux workstation.

<p>
<b>University Electronic Mail Notification Policy</b>
<br>
All students should become familiar with the University�s official e-mail student notification policy.
