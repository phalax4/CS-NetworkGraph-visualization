Design two transducers whose input and output alphabets are {0, 1}. The first 
transducer takes in as input blocks of 3-bit each, and for each input block,
the transducer outputs the block followed by one output parity bit. For
example, if the input to the first transducer is a block is 001, then this 
transducer outputs the block 0011. The second transducer takes in as input
blocks of 4-bit each, and for each input block, the transducer outputs the
the first three bits in the block followed by either 0 if the fourth bit 
in the input block is the wrong even parity for the first three bits in the
input block, or 1 if the fourth bit in the input block is the correct even 
parity for the first three bits in the input block. For example, if the input
block of the second transducer is 0001, then this transducer outputs the 
block 0000.
