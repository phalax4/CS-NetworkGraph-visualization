   <td><b>Course Overview:</b></td>
	<td>
	Randomness is extremely useful in computer science.
Algorithms that make random choices during their execution, known as randomized algorithms, are often faster or simpler than algorithms that don't use randomness.  
Examples include Quicksort, primality testing, and Monte Carlo simulations. 
However, such randomized algorithms usually come with a small probability of error, so it is important to bound this error probability.  
In this undergraduate course, we develop tools and techniques 
to design and analyze efficient randomized algorithms.
This course is theoretical and mathematical; there will be no programming
assignments.
Each section of the course is built around a method, with example
applications to randomized algorithms.
We list the topics below.

The three exams will be held in class on the following dates:
Exam 1 on Thursday, October 1;
Exam 2 on Thursday, October 29; and
Exam 3 on Thursday, December 3.
No make-up exams will be given, so plan accordingly.  
You may bring a single,
8.5x11 inch, handwritten sheet of paper (you may use both sides).
No calculators are allowed (they won't be necessary).

    <TD><B>Homework:</B></TD>  
	<TD>
	Most weeks a problem set will be assigned.
	<em>Collaboration policy</em>: 
	While you should first think about the problems on your own,
	you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates.  
	Please limit your collaborations on any particular homework to
	at most three other students.
	You must write up your own solutions.  
	In particular, nobody should email partial or full solutions 
	to anybody.
	You must acknowledge any collaboration by writing
	your collaborators' names on the front page of the assignment.  
	You don't lose points by having collaborators.

	<p>
        <em>Citation policy</em>:
	Try to solve the problems without reading any published literature
	or websites, besides the class text and links off of the class
	web page.
	If, however,
	you do use a solution or part of a solution that you found
	in the literature or on the web, you must cite it.
	Furthermore, you must write up the solution in your own words.
	You will get at most half credit for solutions found in the literature
	or on the web.
	</p>

	<p>
	<em>Submission policy</em>:
	Homeworks are due at the beginning of class.
	No late homeworks will be accepted.

The use of laptops and mobile devices is generally prohibited;
however, I will allow use of tablets if you sit in the first row and
