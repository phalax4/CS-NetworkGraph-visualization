<H2>CS361C Assignment 3 </H2>

<P><B>Due:</B> Friday, February 27.  You'll be submitting this one, and
  most subsequent assignments via Canvas.  We'll be setting up the
  link there shortly.<P>

<P><B>Note: you can work with one other student on this project.  If
  you worked with a partner on Assignment 2, use the same partner for
  this one. As usual, you only need one submission, but be sure to
  identify both members of the team and include a sentence explaining
  the contributions of each. </B></P>

<P>In assignment 2 you wrote a draft proposal to an organization
  proposing a scheme to mitigate the risks involved in acquiring and
  deploying COTS products.  Revise your proposal in light of the class
  discussions.  The result should be a final version of your
  proposal.</p>

<p>Be sure to take account of the following information:
  Organizational resources are not sufficient to perform a
  thorough <i>technical</i> assessment for all acquired products given
  the volume of applications within the procurement pipeline.
  Therefore, your proposal must include non-technical assessments.</p>

<!-- <p>Imagine that you are a security consultant to a large organization;
  (you can choose whether the organization is commercial or
  governmental).  The organization annually purchases hundreds of COTS
  (commercial-off-the-shelf) software and/or hardware products from a
  variety of vendors, both foreign and domestic.  These products vary
  widely in functionality, importance to the organizational mission,
  complexity, cost, etc.</p>

<p>Management has recently become concerned that purchasing and
  deploying COTS products might introduce exploitable security
  vulnerabilities into the organization's computing infrastructure.
  They would like you to formulate a strategy to manage this risk.</p>

<p>Write a draft proposal to the management of your organization
  suggesting a screening procedure that could be applied prior to the
  deployment within your organization of any newly acquired COTS
  product.  You can assume that the product has been purchased but is
  awaiting deployment. The outcome of the screening procedure should
  be a determination either that the product is "adequately secure"
  for deployment within the company infrastructure or that it is not.
  Your procedure can use technical and/or non-technical methods.</p>

<p>
  Your draft proposal should justify your suggested procedure,
  explaining how it manages the security risks inherent in using COTS
  products.
</p>

<p>The reason a <i>draft proposal</i> is requested is that this is a
  surprisingly complex question on which you could spend months.  This
  problem is called <i>supply chain security</i>.  Spend an hour or so
  thinking about this problem in the context above and write up your
  initial ideas as a draft.  You will be refining your procedure in a
  later assignment.  There is no page limit; write as much as you need
  to address this question, <i>but not a lot more.</i></p> -->

<h3>Grading Information:</h3> This and subsequent writing assignments
will be graded on the following criteria:
<ol>
<li> Did you do the assignment as specified?
<li> Did you give it adequate thought and care? 
<li> Is your argument well reasoned and supported by evidence?
<li> Is the document formatted reasonably?  (It's better short than
  padded.)
<li> Are references cited correctly?
<li> Is the writing style acceptable? 
</ol>

We're not grading on grammar or spelling, but you should make a
credible effort to write in a style worthy of a student at a top-tier
university.
