In the adopted design, referred to as Design 1, of the Time-To-Live, or TTL 
for short, field in the IP header of a packet is as follows. First, TTL is 
usually assigned a default value 64 when the IP header of the packet is 
created. Second, the value of TTL is decremented by one at each hop. Third, the
packet is discarded when the value of TTL becomes 0.

Now, consider the alternative design, referred to as Design 2, of the TTL 
field. First, TTL is initially assigned the value 0. Second, the value of TTL
is incremented by one at each hop. Third, the packet is discarded when the
value of TTL reaches the default value 64. 

Which of these two designs is better? Explain your answer.

Solution:

Design 1 is better because the source can control the initial value of TTL and 
change it to be any other value instead of the default 64. But in the second 
design, every router has to know the initial value in order to to discard the 
packet.
