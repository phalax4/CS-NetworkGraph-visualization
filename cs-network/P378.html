<H2><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Philosophy and Goal</A>
</H2>

<P>
The foremost goal of this course is to expose the student to the full
range of activities required of a real-life computer science
researcher.  It turns out that computer scientists rarely read
textbooks, sit silently in lectures, work on programming assignments
with correct and complete answers, or take exams.  Rather, they

<UL>
<LI>read about and critically assess original research;
</LI>
<LI>speak in public;
</LI>
<LI>collaborate effectively with peers;
</LI>
<LI>devise solutions and/or approaches to open-ended problems; and 
</LI>
<LI>write about these solutions and/or approaches.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Most upper-division CS students have determined that they enjoy taking
CS classes (or at least that they're relatively good at it).  However,
this determination may not be indicative of a propensity for computer
science <I>research</I>.  This course presents an opportunity for
students to help decide whether they would enjoy going on to graduate
school and an eventual career as a computer science researcher.  In
particular, students will be required to read published research
papers, write brief reactions to them, participate in class
discussions, moderate a class discussion, propose and execute a
solution to a challenging open-ended problem, and write about their
work.  They will be given an opportunity to collaborate with one other
student on the final project.

<P>
The content of the course will be related to autonomous agents.  In
order to succeed, students will need to attain a mastery of the
subject.  However evaluation will be based primarily on the above
activities.  There will be no exams.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
Content Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>
There is no generally accepted definition of artificial intelligence
"agents." But practitioners know them when they see them.  In loose
terms, agents are programs that (i) sense their environment, (ii) make
decisions about how to act based on these sensations, and (iii) then
execute these actions. Autonomous agents do all three of these steps
on their own, i.e. without a human in the loop. Multiagent systems are
collections of multiple agents that interact with one another.

<P>
This course provides a broad introduction to autonomous agents with an
emphasis on multiagent systems. 
Topics include

<UL>
<LI>agent architectures 
</LI>
<LI>inter-agent communication 
</LI>
<LI>teamwork 
</LI>
<LI>distributed rational decision making 
</LI>
<LI>agent modeling 
</LI>
<LI>multiagent learning 
</LI>
<LI>entertainment agents
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
There will be incremental programming assignments leading to a final
project, and ultimately a tournament competition in the RoboCup soccer
simulator.  Students will be encouraged to work in pairs on the
final project.

<P>
The course also has a significant writing component and carries the
writing flag.  Brief written
answers to questions based on the reading will be assigned weekly.
There will be a project proposal halfway through the semester with an
opportunity for revisions in the form of a progress report.  The grade
for the final project will be based largely on the written report due
at the end of the semester.

<P>
Participation in the class discussions will also form a significant
part of the grade.  Class meetings will consist of discussions based
on assigned readings.  Each student will be responsible for moderating
one discussion.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00080000000000000000">
Content Objective</A>
</H2>

<P>
With respect to content, the goal of this course is to give the
student an appreciation for the broad research topics currently being
pursued in the field of autonomous agents and multiagent systems.  By
the end of the course, the student should be able to

<UL>
<LI>Identify and discuss the characteristics of agent-based systems;
  and
</LI>
<LI>Program actual agents in one multiagent environment.
</LI>
</UL>
The course is designed to include key activities engaged in by
researchers, including generation of ideas and programs, critical oral
discussion of ideas, and written evaluation and presentation of ideas.

<P>
The course is designed to present a solid entry point to the field of
artificial intelligence.  For those students with interest, it could
possibly lead to subsequent research opportunities.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Written responses to readings-based questions (15%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Weekly

readings will be posted on the class website on Tuesday to be due the
following Tuesday.  Associated with most readings will be questions
that should be answered with concise, well-thought-out, coherent
written responses by email to the instructor and the TA.  The email
should be <b>in plain ascii text in the body of the email (not an
attachment)</b>. Please use the subject line "class readings for [due
date]".  In some cases, no specific questions will be posted.  In
those cases, the responses should be free form.Credit will be based on
evidence that you have done the readings carefully.  Acceptable
responses include (but are not limited to):
   <menu>
   <li> Insightful questions;
   <li> Clarification questions about ambiguities;
   <li> Comments about the relation of the reading to previous readings;
   <li> Critiques; 
   <li> Thoughts on what you would like to learn about in more detail;
   <li> Possible extensions or related studies; 
   <li> Thoughts on the paper's importance; and
   <li> Summaries of the most important things you learned.
   </menu>

These responses will be graded on a 10-point scale and graded mostly
on written expression and coherence of argument (most questions will
not have a ``right'' answer).  Answers will be due by 9pm on Monday.
Responses received between then and 11a.m. on Tuesday will be deducted
1 point (for a maximum score of 9).  Responses received between then
and 11a.m. on Thursday will be deducted 2 points (for a maximum score
of 8).  Responses received after that will be deducted 4 points (for a
maximum score of 6).

<P>
These deadlines are designed both to encourage you to do the readings
before class and also to allow us to incorporate some of your
responses into the class discussions.

<P>
<DT><STRONG> Class participation (15%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
Students are expected to be present in class having completed the
readings and participate actively in the discussions.
</DD><p>

<DT><STRONG> OPTION A: Oral presentation/discussion moderation (10%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
Students will have the option to lead a discussion on one of the
readings.  The discussion can begin with a brief summary/overview of
the important points in the readings, but the assumption is to be that
everyone has already completed the readings.  The student may either
present material related to the readings (perhaps from an outside
source) or moderate a class discussion about the readings.  In the
latter case, the student must be prepared to keep the conversation
flowing.  Here are some <a href="discussion-tips.txt">tips on leading
a discussion</a>. <br>
<!--
Here is the current <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Courses/378spring06/discussion-schedule.pdf">discussion leader schedule</a>.
!-->
</DD><p>

<DT><STRONG> OPTION B: Peer review (10%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
Students who don't lead a discussion will be expected to do critical
peer reviews of two classmates' progress reports.  The feedback should be
detailed, constructive, and prompt.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Initial programming assignments (10%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A series of 4
incremental programming assignments will be assigned during the first
half of the semester.  Their purpose is to familiarize you with the
software you will be using in the final project and to give you direct
experience with some of the concepts covered in the readings.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Project proposal draft (5%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Midway through the semester, you
will propose a topic for your final project.  The proposal will be in
written form.  You are
expected to propose to work with one other student on the final
project, but each student must turn in an independently-written
proposal and final report.  The draft will be evaluated primarily on
written expression and coherence of argument.  Feedback will be given
both on writing and content.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Project progress report (10%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The progress report is mainly a
revision of the proposal.  It should take into account both types of
comments given on the proposal.  Expect it to require significant
rewriting, as opposed to just editing of the proposal.  In addition,
it should include an update on progress to date.  It will be graded
primarily on written expression and coherence of argument.  Feedback
will be given on content.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Final programming project (competition) and written report (35%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In
most cases, the culminating assignment for the course will be a
full-fledged robot soccer team for entry in a class tournament.
Other options will be possible if agreed upon at proposal time.  The
grade for the final project will be based upon the final product
(program) and the written report, which should detail what was done
and relate it to the class readings.  The grade will <B>not</B> be tied
to performance in the tournament.  At the final tournament, students
will describe their final projects orally.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000100000000000000000">
Extension Policy</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you turn in your assignment late, expect points to be deducted.  No
exceptions will be made for the written responses to readings-based
questions (subject to the ``notice about missed work due to religious
holy days'' below).  For other assignments, extensions will be
considered on a case-by-case basis, but in most cases they will not be
granted.  

<P> For the penalties on responses to the readings see above (under
course requirements).  For other assignments, by default, 5 points
(out of 100) will be deducted for lateness, plus an additional 1 point
for every 24-hour period beyond 2 that the assignment is late.  For
example, an assignment due at 2pm on Tuesday will have 5 points
deducted if it is turned in late but before 2pm on Thursday.  It will
have 6 points deducted if it is turned in by 2pm Friday, etc.

<P>
The greater the advance notice of a need for an extension, the greater
the likelihood of leniency.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000110000000000000000">
Academic Dishonesty Policy</A>
</H2>

<P> You are encouraged to discuss assignments with classmates.  But
all written work must be your own.  And programming assignments must
be your own except for 2-person teams on the final project.  All work
ideas, quotes, and code fragments that originate from elsewhere must
be cited according to standard academic practice. Students caught
cheating will automatically fail the course.  If in doubt, look
at the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html#honesty">departmental
guidelines</a> and/or ask.
<p>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000120000000000000000">
Notice about students with disabilities</A>
</H2>

<P>
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate
academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities.  To
determine if you qualify, please contact the Dean of Students at
471-6529; 471-4641 TTY.  If they certify your needs, I will work with
you to make appropriate arrangements.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000130000000000000000">
Notice about missed work due to religious holy days</A>
</H2>

<P>
A student who misses an examination, work assignment, or other project
due to the observance of a religious holy day will be given an
opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after
the absence, provided that he or she has properly notified the
instructor.  It is the policy of the University of Texas at Austin
that the student must notify the instructor at least fourteen days
prior to the classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent to
observe a religious holy day.  For religious holy days that fall
within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given
on the first day of the semester.  The student will not be penalized
for these excused absences, but the instructor may appropriately
respond if the student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed
assignment or examination within a reasonable time after the excused
absence.
