<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The course contest involves a multi-player capture-the-flag variant 
of Pacman, where agents control both Pacman and ghosts in coordinated 
team-based strategies.  Your team will try to eat the food on the far 
side of the map, while defending the food on your home side.  The 
contest code is available as a <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Courses/343Hfall17/assignments/contest/contest.zip">zip archive</a>.

</p><h3>Rules of Pacman Capture the Flag</h3>

<b>Layout:</b> The Pacman map is now divided into two halves: blue 
(right) and red (left).  Red agents (which all have even indices) must 
defend the red food while trying to eat the blue food.  When on the red 
side, a red agent is a ghost.  When crossing into enemy territory, the 
agent becomes a Pacman.

<p><b>Scoring:</b>  When a Pacman eats a food dot, the food is 
permanently removed and one point is scored for that Pacman's team.  Red
 team scores are positive, while Blue team scores are negative.

</p><p><b>Eating Pacman:</b> When a Pacman is eaten by an opposing 
ghost, the Pacman returns to its starting position (as a ghost).  No 
points are awarded for eating an opponent. Ghosts may be able to eaten -- so maps contain power pellets, others do not.

</p><p><b>Winning:</b> A game ends when one team eats all but two of the
 opponents' dots.  Games are also limited to 3000 agent moves.  If this 
move limit is reached, whichever team has eaten the most food wins.

</p><p><b>Computation Time:</b> Each agent has 1 second to return each 
action. Each move which does not return within one second will incur a 
warning.  After three warnings, or any single move taking more than 3 
seconds, the game is forfeit.  There will be an initial start-up 
allowance of 15 seconds (use the <code>registerInitialState</code> function).

</p><p><b>Observations:</b> Agents can only observe an opponent's 
configuration (position and direction) if they or their teammate is 
within 5 squares (Manhattan distance).  In addition, an agent always 
gets a noisy distance reading for each agent on the board, which can be 
used to approximately locate unobserved opponents.


</p><h3> Submission Instructions </h3>

To enter an agent into the nightly tournaments, follow these <a href="contest-submission.html">instructions</a>.

<!-- To enter an agent into the nightly tournaments, properly fill out <code><a href="docs/config.html">config.py</a></code> with your team name, agents, and other options.  Make a zip archive named <tt>contest.zip</tt>, containing this and the rest of your files (no subdirectories within the zip file please). Register your team <a href="ai-contest-master/register.html">here</a>. If you are working with another student please register only a single group. Make note of the key that will be generated for your team. You will need it to enter the nightly competitions.

Once your team is registered, you can submit your agent <a href="ai-contest-master/upload.html">here</a>.
<p>For your reference, we have provided a sample <code><a href="docs/config.html">config.py</a></code> configured for the <code> BaselineAgent</code>. The <code>BaselineAgent</code> directory itself is inside the <code>teams</code> directory.  Make sure to pick a unique team name! -->

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

By default, you can run a four-agent game with simple <code>BaselineAgents</code> that the staff has provided:

<pre>python capture.py</pre>

<p>A wealth of options are available to you:

</p><pre>python capture.py --help</pre>

The --frameTime option can be useful for controlling the speed of the 
displayed game.
There are six slots for agents, where agents 0, 2 and 4 are always on 
the red team and 1, 3 and 5 on the blue team.  Agents are created by 
agent factories (one for Red, one for Blue). However, the nightly competitions will be played with only two agents on each team. See the section on 
designing agents for a description of the agents invoked above.

The only agents available now are the <code>BaselineAgents</code>. They are chosen by default, but as an example of how to choose teams:

<pre>python capture.py -r BaselineAgents -b BaselineAgents </pre>

which specifies that the red team <code>-r</code> and the blue team <code>-b</code> are <code>BaselineAgents</code>.

To control an agent with the keyboard, pass the appropriate option to the red team:

<pre>python capture.py --redOpts first=keys</pre>

The arrow keys control your character, which will change from ghost to Pacman when crossing the center line.



<h3>Game Types</h3>

You can play the game in two ways: local games, and nightly tournaments.

<p>Local games (described above) allow you to test your agents against 
the baseline team we provide and are intended for use in development.


</p><h3><a name="tournaments">Official Tournaments</a></h3><a name="tournaments">

The actual competitions will be run using nightly automated tournaments,
 with the final tournament deciding the final contest outcome.  To enter
 an agent into the nightly tournaments, make sure to properly fill in <code></code></a><code><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Courses/343Hfall17/assignments/contest/docs/config.html">config.py</a></code> and then follow these <b><code><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Courses/343Hfall17/assignments/contest/contest-submission.html">submission instructions</a></code></b>.
  Be sure to pick a unique name for your team.  Tournaments are run 
everyday at midnight and include all teams that have been submitted 
(either earlier in the day or on a previous day) as of the start of the 
tournament.  Currently, each team plays every other team in a best-of-3 
match, but this may change later in the semester.  The <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Courses/343Hfall17/assignments/contest/ai-contest-master/results/">results</a> are updated on the website after the tournament completes each night.

<h3>Designing Agents</h3>

Unlike project 2, an agent now has the more complex job of trading off 
offense versus defense and effectively functioning as both a ghost and a
 Pacman in a team setting.   Furthermore, the limited information 
provided to your agent will likely necessitate some probabilistic 
tracking (like project 4).  Finally, the added time limit of computation
 introduces new challenges.

<p><b>Baseline Agents:</b> To kickstart your agent design, we have provided you with two baseline agents.  They are both quite bad.
The <code>OffensiveReflexAgent</code> moves toward the closest food on the opposing side.  The <code>DefensiveReflexAgent</code> wanders around on its own side and tries to chase down invaders it happens to see.

</p><p><b>Directory Structure:</b> You should place your agent code in a new sub-directory of the teams directory.  You will need a <code><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/pstone/Courses/343Hfall17/assignments/contest/docs/config.html">config.py</a></code> file, which specifies your team name, authors, agent factory class, and agent options.  See the <code>BaselineAgents</code> example for details.

</p><p><b>Interface:</b> The <code>GameState</code> in <code><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Courses/343Hfall17/assignments/contest/docs/capture.html">capture.py</a></code> should look familiar, but contains new methods like <code>getRedFood</code>,
 which gets a grid of food on the red side (note that the grid is the 
size of the board, but is only true for cells on the red side with 
food).  Also, note that you can list a team's indices with <code>getRedTeamIndices</code>, or test membership with <code>isOnRedTeam</code>.

</p><p>Finally, you can access the list of noisy distance observations via <code>getAgentDistances</code>.
  These distances are within 6 of the truth, and the noise is chosen 
uniformly at random from the range [-6, 6] (e.g., if the true distance 
is 6, then each of {0, 1, ..., 12} is chosen with probability 1/13).  
You can get the likelihood of a noisy reading using <code>getDistanceProb</code>.

</p><p><b>Distance Calculation: </b>To facilitate agent development, we provide code in <code><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Courses/343Hfall17/assignments/contest/docs/distanceCalculator.html">distanceCalculator.py</a></code> to supply shortest path maze distances.  

</p><p>To get started designing your own agent, we recommend subclassing the <code>CaptureAgent</code> class.  This provides access to several convenience methods.  Some useful methods are:

</p><pre>  def getFood(self, gameState):
    """
    Returns the food you're meant to eat. This is in the form
    of a matrix where m[x][y]=true if there is food you can
    eat (based on your team) in that square.
    """

  def getFoodYouAreDefending(self, gameState):
    """
    Returns the food you're meant to protect (i.e., that your
    opponent is supposed to eat). This is in the form of a
    matrix where m[x][y]=true if there is food at (x,y) that
    your opponent can eat.
    """

  def getOpponents(self, gameState):
    """
    Returns agent indices of your opponents. This is the list
    of the numbers of the agents (e.g., red might be "1,3,5")
    """

  def getTeam(self, gameState):
    """
    Returns agent indices of your team. This is the list of
    the numbers of the agents (e.g., red might be "1,3,5")
    """

  def getScore(self, gameState):
    """
    Returns how much you are beating the other team by in the
    form of a number that is the difference between your score
    and the opponents score. This number is negative if you're
    losing.
    """

  def getMazeDistance(self, pos1, pos2):
    """
    Returns the distance between two points; These are calculated using the provided
    distancer object.

    If distancer.getMazeDistances() has been called, then maze distances are available.
    Otherwise, this just returns Manhattan distance.
    """

  def getPreviousObservation(self):
    """
    Returns the GameState object corresponding to the last
    state this agent saw (the observed state of the game last
    time this agent moved - this may not include all of your
    opponent's agent locations exactly).
    """

  def getCurrentObservation(self):
    """
    Returns the GameState object corresponding this agent's
    current observation (the observed state of the game - this
    may not include all of your opponent's agent locations
    exactly).
    """

</pre>



<p><b>Restrictions:</b> You are free to design any agent you want.  
However, you will need to respect the provided APIs if you want to 
participate in the tournaments.  Agents which compute during the 
opponent's turn will be disqualified. In fact, we do not recommend any 
sort of multi-threading.

<!--Because the tournament will be run using the online architecture, you can run your agent from your machine using any resources or code you want; you can even write code in different programming languages if you so desire.  Change pacclient.py at your own risk, though, because you don't want to break the network functionality. //-->

</p><h3>Contest Details</h3>

<p>The contest has two parts: a qualifying round and a final tournament.
</p><ul>
    <li> <strong>Qualifying:</strong> Every night, we will post the 
results of a round robin tournament among all submitted agents, 
including a qualifying "Staff Agents" team. To qualify for the final 
tournament, you must first submit your agents according to the <a href="#tournaments">instructions</a>. Then, you must be <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Courses/343Hfall17/assignments/contest/ai-contest-master/results/">ranked</a>
 ahead of Staff Agents in one of the nightly tournaments before the 
qualification deadline. The earlier you submit your agents, the more 
chances you have to qualify!
    </li><li> <strong>Tournament:</strong> (details subject to change)  A
 final double-elimination tournament will be run on the evening before the last day of class. The final lecture the next 
day will include replays of important matches. The final tournament will
 be similar to the defaultCapture layout.
