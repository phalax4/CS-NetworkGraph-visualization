A note before you proceed to the deadlock notes...
<p align="left">
The deadlock notes were developed (and are hosted on the website of) Dr.
John T. Bell at the University of Illinois, Chicago.
</p>

<p align="left">
Dr. Bell developed those notes using the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz/dp/1118063333/"<u>Operating System Concepts,
Ninth Edition</u></a>, by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne.
</p>
<p>
This book, also known as "The Dinosaur Book", is a very popular and
well-respected OS textbook, and I highly recommend it to you.
(A (much) earlier edition was the required textbook for my undergrad OS course.)

<p>
And now, for our feature presentation (drum roll, please)...
